## LEGAL NOTES AND SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

1. **Dual Intent Provisions**: As per IRPA s.22(2), having a pending PR application does not preclude obtaining temporary resident status. However, the officer must be satisfied you will leave Canada at the end of your authorized stay if your PR application is not finalized.

2. **Previous Refusals**: Previous refusals create a presumption that may need to be overcome. The detailed letter of explanation is essential to address these concerns directly.

3. **Provincial Nominee LMIA Exemption**: The BC PNP support letter provides eligibility for an LMIA exemption under exemption code T13. This is a critical advantage for your application.

4. **Processing Expectations**: 
   - Current processing times for work permits from China: Approximately 8-12 weeks
   - Biometrics processing: Additional 2-3 weeks
   - TRV processing: May be concurrent with work permit processing

5. **Port of Entry Considerations**: Upon approval, you will receive a letter of introduction. The actual work permit will be issued at the Port of Entry upon arrival in Canada. Be prepared to present key documents at that time.
