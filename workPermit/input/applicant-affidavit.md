13. I previously worked for the same employer from July 5, 2022, to August 6, 2024, before my status in Canada expired.

## CANADIAN IMMIGRATION HISTORY

14. My previous entries to Canada include:
    - July 5, 2022, to December 7, 2022 (156 days): Work in Richmond, Canada

## EXPLANATION OF PREVIOUS WORK PERMIT REFUSALS

17. In January 2024, while working in Canada, I applied for a Bridge Open Work Permit. This application was denied on August 7, 2024, because it lacked the BC Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) Nomination letter.

18. Following this refusal, I re-applied for a work permit while still in Canada. This second application was also denied in December 2024.

19. On October 1, 2024, I attempted to obtain a work permit through flag-poling, but I was asked to leave Canada because I did not have a valid visa at that time. I complied with this instruction and departed Canada on October 3, 2024.

20. I believe the second application was refused because I had already left Canada at the time of processing.

## CURRENT APPLICATION

21. I am now applying for an employer-specific work permit based on a valid job offer from Foodie-link and pasta and supported by a BC PNP support letter for work permit.

22. I understand that I require a work permit, as well as a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) to enter Canada.

23. I am prepared to undergo a medical examination and provide biometrics as required for my application.

## DUAL INTENT

24. I acknowledge that I have a pending application for permanent residence in Canada that was submitted in December 2022. However, I also have a genuine intent to respect the temporary nature of my work permit.

25. I am fully aware of the requirements under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, Section 22(2), which recognizes that having an intention to become a permanent resident does not preclude me from becoming a temporary resident if I can satisfy an officer that I will leave Canada by the end of the authorized period of stay if permanent residence is not granted.

26. I maintain ties to my home country of China, including:
    - My current residence at 1-1403, 15 Nanhunan Rd, Chaoyang district, Beijing
    - Family connections
    - Professional networks developed over my career

27. I understand and accept that if my permanent residence application is not approved, I will respect the conditions of my temporary status and leave Canada when required.

## TRUTHFULNESS DECLARATION

28. I declare that I have answered all questions truthfully and have disclosed all material facts related to my application.

29. I understand that misrepresentation or withholding material facts could result in my application being refused, or if discovered later, could result in the revocation of my status in Canada.

30. I am committed to abiding by all conditions of my work permit if it is granted, including only working for the employer specified on my work permit.
