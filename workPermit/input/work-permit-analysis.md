**LMIA Requirement:** Exempt based on BC PNP support letter
**Work Permit Type:** Employer-specific

### Immigration History Considerations

The client's immigration history shows several critical factors that will impact this application:

1. **Previous Work in Canada:** Worked in Canada for two years with Foodie Link (2022-2024)
2. **Previous Denials:**
   - Bridge Open Work Permit denied in August 2024 (reason: lacking BC PNP Nomination letter)
   - Second work permit application denied in December 2024 (reason: client had left Canada)
3. **Flag Poling Attempt:** Attempted on October 1, 2024 but was asked to leave Canada due to lack of valid visa
4. **Current Immigration Status:** Left Canada on October 3, 2024, currently in China

### Documentation Assessment

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Potential Application Challenges

1. **Previous Denials:** Two recent work permit denials may impact the current application. Immigration officers will scrutinize the new application more thoroughly.

2. **Immigration Intent:** Having a pending PR application while applying for a temporary work permit may raise dual intent concerns, though this is permissible under Canadian immigration law when properly addressed.

3. **Maintaining Status:** The client previously left Canada after being asked to do so at the border, which demonstrates compliance with immigration requirements.

4. **Job Genuineness:** IRCC may scrutinize the job offer due to the previous employment relationship with the same employer.

5. **Processing Time Impact:** Previous immigration history may lead to increased processing times due to additional verification.

### Strengths of the Application

1. **BC PNP Support Letter:** This is a significant advantage as it provides LMIA exemption and demonstrates provincial endorsement.

2. **Previous Work Experience in Canada:** Demonstrates integration capability and Canadian work history.

3. **Qualified Candidate:** Master's degree and over ten years of experience indicate the client is well-qualified for the position.

4. **Salary Above Prevailing Wage:** The salary of $32.12/hour appears to meet or exceed requirements for this position.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Application Strategy

1. **Application Location:** Apply from outside Canada through the online portal
   - Rationale: Given the recent departure from Canada and visa requirements, applying from outside Canada is appropriate

   - Travel to Canada once all documentation is received

## LEGAL BASIS AND CONSIDERATIONS

This analysis is based on:

1. **Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA):** Sections 22 and 200
2. **Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR):** Regulations 179, 200 and 205
3. **Provincial Nominee Program Guidelines:** British Columbia Provincial Nominee Program

**Jurisprudence Consideration:** In *Huang v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)*, 2013 FC 576, the Federal Court confirmed that a visa officer must consider all relevant evidence in assessing a work permit application, including provincial nomination status.

## CONCLUSION

Libo Zhang appears eligible for an employer-specific work permit under the Provincial Nominee Program stream based on the BC PNP support letter. However, the previous refusals create additional complexity that must be carefully addressed in the application. A comprehensive, well-documented application that directly addresses the previous refusals and clearly establishes eligibility under the PNP stream will maximize chances of approval.

The recommended approach is to submit a thorough application from outside Canada with strong documentation of both the job offer and provincial nomination, accompanied by a detailed explanation letter addressing the previous refusals.
