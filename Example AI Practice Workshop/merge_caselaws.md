BETWEEN:




RAMSAWACK CHOTAI




Applicant




and




THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION




Respondent

JUDGMENT AND REASONS

I.                  Introduction

[1]               This is a judicial review of a decision by the Immigration Appeal Division [IAD] to dismiss the Applicant’s appeal of a decision refusing a second spousal sponsorship application.

II.               Background

[2]               The Applicant, a citizen of Canada and a native of Guyana, married a woman from Guyana in 1999 shortly after his first marriage ended. He sponsored her for permanent residence, but the IAD in 2001 denied the spousal application because the relationship was not genuine and was entered into primarily for immigration purposes. The marriage ended shortly thereafter.

[3]               The Applicant then met his current wife in 2007 in a telephone conversation through the future wife’s sister. They were married three weeks after their first in-person meeting. The Applicant sponsored his wife’s permanent residence application, but this was denied on the grounds that the relationship was not bona fide and was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring status under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27, in accordance with s 4 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227 [Regulations].

4. (1) For the purposes of these Regulations, a foreign national shall not be considered a spouse, a common-law partner or a conjugal partner of a person if the marriage, common-law partnership or conjugal partnership

	

4. (1) Pour l’application du présent règlement, l’étranger n’est pas considéré comme étant l’époux, le conjoint de fait ou le partenaire conjugal d’une personne si le mariage ou la relation des conjoints de fait ou des partenaires conjugaux, selon le cas :




(a) was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act; or

	

a) visait principalement l’acquisition d’un statut ou d’un privilège sous le régime de la Loi;




(b) is not genuine.

	

b) n’est pas authentique.

[4]               That decision was appealed to the IAD. In dismissing the appeal, the IAD held that the wife was using the Applicant to obtain status in Canada. That decision was not appealed.

[5]               The Applicant then filed a second sponsorship application, which was refused in January 2014 pursuant to s 4 of the Regulations. The IAD dismissed the appeal, finding that the principles of res judicata were applicable.

[6]               The two principal issues dealt with by the IAD were 1) whether the principle of res judicata applies, precluding the Applicant from litigating an appeal previously decided, and 2) whether there was an abuse of process or breach of natural justice in not permitting an oral hearing.

[7]               In the IAD’s consideration of the issue estoppel branch of res judicata, it outlined the two-step process from Danyluk v Ainsworth Technologies Inc, 2001 SCC 44, [2001] 2 SCR 460 [Danyluk]) which must be engaged. Firstly, one must establish that the preconditions of issue estoppel exist. Secondly, one must consider whether issue estoppel should apply.

[8]               The IAD found the preconditions for issue estoppel to exist:

•                     the same question had been decided;

•                     the decision was final; and

•                     the parties (or their privies) were the same.

[9]               In determining that issue estoppel ought to apply, the IAD concluded that 1) the Applicant’s alleged new evidence is not decisive fresh evidence that could not have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence in the first application, and 2) the evidence was not demonstrably capable of altering the results of the first application.

[10]           The new evidence was found not to address the matters which formed the basis of the first decision. The new evidence did not address conflicting evidence about the wife’s prior relationships and employment; it included implausible explanations for information in a previous temporary residence application; it did not address the wife’s failure to inform the Applicant of her prior application; and it did not address the timing and fast development of the relationship.

While the Applicant was genuinely invested in the relationship, it was the wife’s intentions which led to the dismissal of the appeal. The fresh evidence did not materially challenge the finding that the wife was using the Applicant to gain residency in Canada.

[11]           On the issue of procedural fairness in not holding an oral hearing (as credibility was alleged to be at issue), the IAD held that it was not assessing credibility but asking whether, assuming the evidence to be credible, it is sufficient to overcome the concerns in the first proceeding. No finding of credibility was made in respect of whether res judicata should be applied. Therefore, there was no denial of natural justice.

III.            Analysis
A.               Issues

[12]           The issues are:

•                     was the decision of the IAD to apply the principles of res judicata lawful?

•                     was the decision of the IAD to deny an oral hearing a breach of natural justice?

B.                 Standard of Review

[13]           The Applicant argues that correctness is the standard of review in respect to both issues. The Applicant is only partially correct.

[14]           In respect to the application of the principle of res judicata, there are two aspects to the issue attracting different standards of review.

[15]           The first aspect is whether res judicata arises at all (i.e. whether the preconditions for issue estoppel have been met). This is a legal determination of general application which does not engage the IAD’s expertise. It must be determined on a correctness standard (see Danyluk).

[16]           The second aspect is whether res judicata ought to be applied. This is a discretionary matter and is to be reviewed under the reasonableness standard.

[17]           On the issue of an oral hearing, the Respondent argues that the issue of how to proceed is a discretionary matter left to the decision maker – therefore, a matter of reasonableness.

Absent a codified procedure, the Respondent’s position is circular. The IAD does have the discretion to choose how to proceed; however, if that choice leads to a denial of natural justice, it cannot be upheld on the basis of reasonableness. A denial of natural justice is not a discretionary matter for which deference is owed.

C.                 Res Judicata

[18]           Neither party contests that the principle of res judicata arises; they dispute whether it should be applied. The Applicant’s position that the new evidence is sufficiently important as to alter the first decision is intricately woven into the issue of the need for an oral hearing.

[19]           The Applicant’s position can be summarised as follows: the new evidence (such of it as is truly new) shows that the relationship is real. Since it shows the continuum of a relationship said to be one of convenience, it shows that the relationship is genuine and rebuts the original decision. The thesis is that the longer a couple stays together, the more genuine the relationship.

[20]           The issue in this case is not whether the relationship has become genuine. Section 4 of the Regulations does not speak to the state of the relationship from time to time but whether it “was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act” (emphasis added). It speaks to the state of the relationship, its purpose at the time at which it was entered.

Subparagraph (b) (“is not genuine”) speaks to the state of the relationship at the time it is being considered.

However, the decision is grounded in subparagraph (a), not subparagraph (b).

[21]           As such, the “fresh evidence” must be evaluated with a view to whether it is sufficient to address and materially change the original decision. This is the distinguishing feature between this case and Sami v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 539, 215 ACWS (3d) 190, where the fresh evidence addressed the IAD’s initial concerns.

[22]           The IAD correctly applied the preconditions to issue estoppel. Its decision to apply res judicata was reasonable because the evidence was insufficient to alter the original decision. The fresh evidence did not address the actions of the wife, her conflicting information, her implausible explanations for earlier attempts to enter Canada on her own nor the lack of transparency toward the Applicant in not disclosing to him her prior attempts to enter Canada. These factors are compounded by her speedy development of a relationship with the Applicant.

D.               Procedural Fairness

[23]           The Applicant’s reliance on the absence of an oral hearing is misplaced. He argues that since credibility is in issue, he was entitled to an oral hearing so as to dispel those credibility concerns.

[24]           However, credibility was not in issue. The IAD examined the evidence on the presumption that it was credible and accepted. The issue is one of sufficiency, not credibility.

[25]           As such, an oral hearing was not necessary. There was no denial of natural justice or breach of procedural fairness.

IV.            Conclusion

[26]           For these reasons this judicial review will be dismissed.

[27]           The parties have been granted leave to make submissions with respect to a certified question.

THIS COURT’S JUDGMENT is that the application for judicial review is dismissed.

BETHEL BAHTA

THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP




AND IMMIGRATION




Respondent

ORDER AND REASONS

(Oral Reasons delivered in Toronto on November 18, 2014)

[1]               Bethel Bahta, [the Principle Applicant], and her two sons, Buruk and Nathan Biniam, collectively [the Applicants] have applied for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board [the RAD] dated July 5, 2013, which dismissed the Applicants’ appeal from a negative decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board [the Board] dated April 26, 2013.  This application is made pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [the IRPA].

The Board’s Decision

[2]               The Board reached alternative conclusions. It found that the Principle Applicant’s evidence was not credible and it also found that the Eritrean birth certificates [the Certificates] submitted to establish the Applicants’ Eritrean identities were false. The Certificates were deemed to be false because they were laminated and showed no signs of wear and because the envelope in which they were sent to Canada was not produced. The Board reached these conclusions without telling the Principle Applicant that the Certificates appeared too pristine to be credible. Accordingly, the Principle Applicant was not able to testify about how the Certificates had been stored and whether or not they had ever been used in Eritrea.

The RAD Decision

[3]               Although it espoused using the reasonableness standard of review, the RAD did not in fact consider the reasonableness of the Board’s conclusions about the lack of an envelope and the new appearance of the Certificates. The RAD also drew no conclusion about the Board’s failure to give the Principle Applicant an opportunity to address its concerns about the Certificates. Instead, the RAD considered the Certificates afresh and decided that, even if they were legitimate, they did not establish the Applicants’ identities because they included no picture, no finger prints, and no physical descriptions. In short, the RAD found that nothing connected the Applicants with the Certificates.

[4]               The RAD noted that when the Applicants made their refugee claims, no identity documents were provided. As well, it noted that the Board wrote to the Principle Applicant’s counsel before the hearing and asked for national identity cards and any other documents which might prove the Applicants’ identities. The Certificates were produced in response to this request.

[5]               The RAD refused to consider the further identity documents offered by the Applicants. There were five such documents, but only one is now at issue. It is a letter of May 14, 2012 [the Letter] from the Eritrean Canadian Community Centre of Metropolitan Toronto in which two witnesses [the Witnesses] attest to the Principle Applicant’s Eritrean identity. Both Witnesses say that they knew the Principle Applicant as a child in Eritrea and knew her parents as well.

[6]               The RAD considered section 110(4) of the IRPA and found that because the information in the Letter went back to the principle Applicant’s childhood, it predated the Board’s hearing.  The Principle Applicant explained that she did not know that the Letter would be needed because the Certificates had been provided and she expected that they would be accepted as proof of the Applicants’ identities. She also said that, since she had been living in a shelter, she had not reached out to the Eritrean community and was not aware before the Board’s hearing that the Witnesses were in Toronto.

[7]               The RAD noted these explanations but did not comment on them. It simply concluded that it was reasonable to expect the Principle Applicant to have provided the Letter when asked by the Board for identity documents.

[8]               Finally, the RAD decided that it did not need to deal with credibility since the Applicants had not established their identities.

[9]               There are two issues:

1)        Did the RAD state and apply the correct standard of review?

2)        Did the RAD act reasonably when it refused to accept the Letter?

Issue 1

[10]           As noted above, the RAD stated that it would apply the reasonableness standard to the Board’s decision, and that it would show deference to its findings of fact. I agree with Mr. Justice Phelan’s conclusion in Huruglica v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 799, at paragraph 25 that correctness is the standard of review that should apply on this issue.

[11]           I have decided that the RAD’s choice of reasonableness as the standard of review is not correct because it makes no sense to conclude that Parliament would mandate identical judicial review proceedings in both the RAD and the Federal Court. Many of my colleagues have reached similar conclusions, see: Iyamuremye v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 494; Yetna v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 858; Spasoja v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 913; Alyafi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 952; Huruglica v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 799; Singh v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 1022.

[12]           In Huruglica at paragraph 40, Mr. Justice Phelan included the following quotation from remarks made in Parliament by The Honourable Jason Kennedy, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration:

I reiterate that the bill would also create the new refugee appeal division. The vast majority of claimants who are coming from countries that do normally produce refugees would for the first time, if rejected at the refugee protection division, have access to a full fact-based appeal at the refugee appeal division of the IRB. This is the first government to have created a full fact-based appeal. [my emphasis]

[13]           This quotation is found in Hansard, 41st Parliament, 1st Session, No. 90, Tuesday, March 6, 2012, at page 5,874.

[14]           In my view, the Minister’s description of the appeal process as a “full fact-based appeal” means that neither judicial review nor the traditional appellate review for “palpable or overriding error” described by Mr. Justice Shore in Alvarez v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 CF 702 (CanLII), 2014 FC 702, are models for the RAD in the IRPA.

[15]           The hybrid model for the RAD described by Mr. Justice Phelan in Huruglica at paragraph 54 appears to me to meet the requirement for a “full fact-based appeal”. The RAD appeal is hybrid in the sense that the evidence may be of two types. There is evidence the RAD may decide to receive which was not before the Board.  It is given a first and fresh assessment. At the same time, the evidence in the record which was before the Board is reconsidered by the RAD. In each case, the RAD makes its own independent assessment of the evidence.

[16]           Lastly, it is my conclusion that there is no deference owed by the RAD to the Board on questions of fact because:

                        i.                  both the Board and the RAD are expert bodies; and

                       ii.                  there is an appeal as of right on questions of fact; and

                     iii.                  the Minister’s statement shows that Parliament intended there to be a “full fact-based appeal”.

[17]           As noted above, the Board actually adopted the proper approach and independently assessed the Certificates. In my view, it reached a reasonable, albeit unusual, conclusion when it decided that, even if valid, the Certificates did not establish the Applicants’ identities because there is nothing to link the Applicants with the Certificates.

Issue 2

[18]           In my view, it was reasonable for the Applicants to expect that the Certificates, which are traditional identity documents, would establish their identities.  Given this expectation, they had no reason to believe that their identities would require further proof by means of a document such as the Letter.  The Board unreasonably failed to consider this circumstance. The Board also unreasonably failed to appreciate that the Letter was not available at the hearing before the Board because the Applicant did not know that the Witnesses were in Toronto.  Finally, it was unreasonable to reject the Letter because the information it contained pre-dated the Board’s hearing.  The salient point is that it was not available to the Applicant.

Certified Question for Appeal

[19]           The Applicant asked that the question that Mr. Justice Phelan certified in Huruglica be certified in this case. It reads as follows: “What is the scope of the Refugee Appeal Division’s review when considering an appeal of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division?”

[20]           However, the Respondent submits that, on the facts of this case, the question is not determinative. I agree because although the Board stated the wrong test, it did not apply it. Accordingly, the question will not be certified.




ORDER

THIS COURT ORDERS that this matter is referred back to the RAD. It is to receive the Letter as evidence and is to conduct an independent assessment of whether the Applicants’ identities are established. If the RAD is satisfied about the identities, it is to reconsider the evidence of the Principle Applicant before the Board and is to reach an independent conclusion about her credibility.

PRESENT:   The Honourable Mr. Justice Annis

BETWEEN:




DAVID CRAIG KENNEDY




Applicant




and




THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION




Respondent

JUDGMENT AND REASONS

[1]               This is an application for judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [the Act] challenging a decision of a Citizenship and Immigration officer [the Officer] refusing to continue processing the Applicant’s permanent resident application under the Spouse or Common-Law Partner in Canada class [spousal sponsorship application].

[2]               For the reasons that follow, the application is dismissed.

I.                  Background

[3]               The Applicant is a citizen of the United States. In 2011, the Applicant entered into a common law relationship with a Canadian citizen and applied for permanent resident under the Spouse or Common-Law Partner in Canada class.

[4]               On February 10, 2014, Citizenship and Immigration Canada [CIC] received the Applicant’s spousal sponsorship application.

[5]               On June 1, 2015, CIC sent the Applicant a letter by way of email indicating that the Applicant had to submit an immigration medical examination within 30 days (July 1, 2015) in order for CIC to continue processing his spousal sponsorship application.

[6]               The request went unanswered as the email was redirected to the Applicant’s email spam folder.

[7]               On September 1, 2015, CIC sent the Applicant a letter by way of email, which was not re-directed into his spam folder, indicating that CIC would no longer continue to process the Applicant’s spousal sponsorship application for not having submitted his immigration medical examination.

[8]               On the same day, September 1, 2015, the Applicant sent a reconsideration request to CIC asking for an additional 60 days to complete the immigration medical examination.

[9]               On September 15, 2015, the Applicant filed an application for leave and judicial review of CIC’s September 1, 2015 decision.

II.               Impugned Decision

[10]           The Officer concluded that the Applicant did not meet the requirements to immigrate to Canada pursuant to subsection 16(1) of the Act as he failed to submit an immigration medical examination which CIC requested in a letter sent to the Applicant by way of email on June 1, 2015. The letter stated the immigration medical examination was required in order to assess the Applicant’s spousal sponsorship application, failure of which could result in the refusal of the spousal sponsorship application. On September 1, 2015, there were no documents filed and as a result, the Officer refused the application.

III.            Legislative Framework

[11]           The following provision of the Act is applicable in these proceedings:

16 (1) A person who makes an application must answer truthfully all questions put to them for the purpose of the examination and must produce a visa and all relevant evidence and documents that the officer reasonably requires.

	

16 (1) L’auteur d’une demande au titre de la présente loi doit répondre véridiquement aux questions qui lui sont posées lors du contrôle, donner les renseignements et tous éléments de preuve pertinents et présenter les visa et documents requis.

IV.            Issue

[12]           This application raises the sole issue of whether the Officer breached his or her duty of procedural fairness owed to the Applicant in processing the Applicant’s spousal sponsorship application.

V.               Standard of Review

[13]           The parties agree, and I concur, that the applicable standard of review for issues of procedural fairness in permanent resident applications is correctness (Khan v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 503 at para 12 [Khan]).

VI.            Analysis

[14]           The Applicant submits that the Respondent breached its procedural fairness obligation towards the Applicant when it refused his application based on a June 1, 2015 email request that went unanswered because the email, unknowingly to the Applicant, was redirected to his spam folder.

[15]           The case law surrounding issues of email miscommunication has developed into two lines of cases. Justice Boswell in Chandrakantbhai Patel v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 900 summarized the two trends at paragraphs 36 and 37 as follows:

[36]           Although some of the cases cited above have tried to reconcile the jurisprudence, the cases are not entirely consistent with each other. The first line of cases essentially holds that the Minister need only prove two things: (1) that the impugned communication was sent to an e-mail address supplied by the applicant; and (2) there has been no indication that the communication may have failed or bounced-back. If that is proven, then it does not matter if the applicant received the communication or not, since the respondent has satisfied the duty of procedural fairness (see: e.g., Kaur at paragraph 12; Yang at paragraphs 8 and 9; Alavi at paragraph 5; Halder at paragraph 48; Patel at paragraph 16; Khan at paragraph 13).

[37]           However, in Yazdani and Zare, the Court was satisfied that the respondent Minister in those cases had sent the e-mails to the correct addresses and still allowed the judicial review applications. This was partly based on a fault analysis in Yazdani, but Zare went even further than that inasmuch as the Court determined that an e-mail request from a visa officer that goes astray is “not properly sent” (Zare at paragraph 49). This can also be seen in Ghaloghlyan when the Court said (at paragraph 8) that “upon proof on a balance of probabilities that a document was sent, a rebuttable presumption arises that the applicant concerned received it, and the applicant's statement that it was not received, on its own, does not rebut the presumption” (emphasis added). The implication of receipt being a rebuttable presumption is that it actually matters whether the applicant received the message, and that is the logic followed in Grenville.

[Emphasis in original.]

[16]           In the case at bar however, whether the two-prong test or the fault analysis approach is applied, the result is the same i.e. the duty of procedural fairness is satisfied. If the two-prong test approach is applied, the first step is to determine whether the communication was sent to the Applicant’s email, which it was. The second step is to determine whether the email failed to deliver or bounce-back, which it did not because the Applicant received it. If the fault based approach is applied, there must be evidence that the document was sent (and there is) and the rebuttable presumption that the Applicant received the email is confirmed by the fact that the Applicant admits to having received the email communication. In both cases, there is no breach of procedural fairness.

[17]           The Applicant relies on my decision in Asoyan v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 206 [Asoyan] for the proposition that when there is no mechanism in place such as the acknowledgement of receipt option for emails to reasonably ensure that an applicant received the communication, the respondent is required to employ it if the burden of procedural fairness is to be discharged. As such, the Applicant submits that since that mechanism was not employed, he was not accorded procedural fairness for the failure of the email not being brought to his attention.

[18]           The Asoyan decision is distinguishable inasmuch as the email was delivered to the Applicant. In Assoyan, I indicated that the use of the receipt option was a means to confirm that the email had reached its destination. In that case the Applicant had no role to play in the failed communication being delivered, as opposed to being delivered but not read. In the case at bar, the Applicant did in fact receive the communication but through the use of a spam filter system, the email was redirected to the Applicant’s spam folder (junk mail box). The responsibility of managing the Applicant’s spam filtering system obviously rests with the Applicant, particularly as email programs indicate that there are items in the spam folder.

[19]           Moreover, I am in agreement with the Respondent that the evidence is insufficient, or at least inconsistent, to demonstrate what actually happened to the email. There is no screen shot showing the email was in the spam folder or how the spam folder operated to filter out communications. There is also no explanation as to why the decision letter in September was not filtered out, while the email to the same address a few months earlier was.

[20]           I continue to be of the view that procedural fairness concerning the transmission of emails entails that the Respondent should be “required to exhaust all reasonable mechanisms available on email programs to ensure receipt of their important transmissions” (Asoyan, para 24). As unfortunate as it is for an Applicant, in the last steps of his lengthy permanent resident application, to have his application refused as a result of email miscommunication, the facts remain that while the Respondent did not have a “send receipt” type of mechanism in place, this in of itself does not offset the fact that the communication was properly delivered by the Respondent and received by the Applicant. That is the purpose of the receipt option. It does not cover what amounts to fault on the part of the Applicant, in failing to read his emails.

VII.         Conclusion

[21]           Accordingly, the application is dismissed and no question is certified for appeal.




JUDGMENT

THIS COURT’S JUDGMENT is that the application is dismissed and no question is certified for appeal.

BETWEEN:




SAMUEL VAN NGUYEN




Applicant




and




THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION




Respondent

JUDGMENT AND REASONS

I.                  Overview

[1]               The applicant Mr. Samuel Van Nguyen wished to sponsor his wife, Mrs. Doan T. Truong Nguyen, a citizen of Vietnam, for permanent residence in Canada. An immigration officer from the High Commission of Canada in Singapore dismissed Mr. Nguyen’s application on the grounds that the marriage is not genuine and that the couple has entered into their relationship primarily for the purpose of obtaining status under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA]. Therefore, Mrs. Truong Nguyen could not be considered a spouse and sponsored in the family class under subsection 4(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227 [Regulations].

[2]               Mr. Nguyen appealed the officer’s decision to the Immigration Appeal Division [IAD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. In December 2015, the IAD dismissed Mr. Nguyen’s appeal, agreeing with the officer’s conclusion that the marriage was motivated primarily by a desire to obtain an immigration advantage.

[3]               Mr. Nguyen has applied to this Court for judicial review of the IAD’s decision. He argues that the decision is unreasonable because it failed to assess the evidence on the genuineness of his marriage, misconstrued the facts and evidence presented, and erroneously took into consideration his previous marriage. Mr. Nguyen also contends that the IAD’s reasons are inadequate since they do not sufficiently explain how the tribunal reached its conclusion. Mr. Nguyen asks this Court to quash the decision and to send it back to the IAD for redetermination by a different panel.

[4]               Mr. Nguyen’s application raises two issues: 1) was the IAD’s decision unreasonable; 2) were the IAD’s reasons inadequate.

[5]               Having considered the evidence before the IAD and the applicable law, I can find no basis for overturning the decision. The IAD’s decision was responsive to the evidence and the outcome is defensible based on the facts and the law. It falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes. I also find that the reasons for the decision adequately explain how the IAD concluded that Mr. Nguyen’s marriage to Mrs. Truong Nguyen is not genuine and was entered into primarily for the purpose of obtaining immigration status in Canada. I must therefore dismiss Mr. Nguyen’s application for judicial review.

II.               Background
A.               The IAD’s Decision

[6]               The IAD’s decision is brief, totalling 15 paragraphs spread over three pages.

[7]       The IAD did not find Mr. Nguyen and Mrs. Truong Nguyen to be credible and trustworthy witnesses. The panel determined that Mr. Nguyen did not provide proof of the genuineness and evolution of his relationship with Mrs. Truong Nguyen. Additionally, the respective testimonies of the two spouses unveiled many discrepancies, in particular with regard to the date of the marriage proposal and their knowledge of each other’s prior marital status.

[8]       The IAD also observed that, not only was Mr. Nguyen having his initial meeting with Mrs. Truong Nguyen in Vietnam at the same time as his first wife was entering Canada as a permanent resident, but he further never lived with his first wife. Also damaging to Mr. Nguyen’s case was that he could not remember his first wife’s name during oral testimony. The IAD therefore concluded that his first marriage was one of convenience and that it was entered into primarily for the purpose that his then wife obtaining permanent resident status.

[9]       A witness, who allegedly knew Mr. Nguyen for 25 years, testified about the genuineness of Mr. Nguyen’s relationship with Mrs. Truong Nguyen. However, the IAD gave little weight to this testimony, as the witness did not even know about Mr. Nguyen’s first marriage.

[10]           The IAD acknowledged that the couple has a child. The panel noted that the existence of a child creates a presumption of genuineness, but determined that this presumption was rebutted in this case and outweighed by the credibility concerns. The IAD further explained that Mr. Nguyen had not “travelled to Vietnam to see his son since his first birthday in 2013” and that there was “very little evidence of financial support” prior to the birth of his child.

B.                 The Standard of Review

[11]           This Court has consistently held that decisions of the IAD, as an expert tribunal, are to be assessed on the reasonableness standard and owed deference (Burton v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 345 [Burton] at para 13; MacDonald v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 978 at para 16). More specifically, whether a marriage is entered into for the primary purpose of immigration is a question of mixed facts and law and a highly factual determination, subject to review on a reasonableness standard (Burton at para 15;  Bercasio v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 244 [Bercasio] at para 17; Aburime v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 194 [Aburime] at para 19; Gill v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1522 [Gill] at para 17).

[12]           As to the issue of adequacy of reasons, it is no longer a stand-alone ground for judicial review and is also to be reviewed under a reasonableness standard (Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union v Newfoundland and Labrador (Treasury Board), 2011 SCC 62 [Newfoundland Nurses] at paras 14-16; Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Gabor, 2015 FC 168 at paras 16-19).

[13]           When reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis is concerned “with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process”, and the IAD’s findings should not be disturbed as long as the decision “falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law” (Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9 [Dunsmuir] at para 47). In conducting a reasonableness review of factual findings, it is not the role of the Court to reweigh the evidence or the relative importance given by the decision-maker to any relevant factor (Kanthasamy v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FCA 113 at para 99). Under a reasonableness standard, as long as the process and the outcome fit comfortably with the principles of justification, transparency and intelligibility, and the decision is supported by acceptable evidence that can be justified in fact and in law, a reviewing court should not substitute its own view of a preferable outcome (Newfoundland Nurses at para 17).

III.            Analysis
A.               Was the IAD’s Decision Unreasonable?

[14]           Mr. Nguyen claims that the IAD’s decision was unreasonable because it failed to assess all of the evidence on the genuineness of his marriage, misconstrued the facts and evidence before it, and erroneously took into consideration his previous marriage to his first wife, a Chinese national.

(1)               Subsection 4(1) is a disjunctive test

[15]           I premise my analysis with the following comment. Mr. Nguyen appears to suggest that, since paragraph 4(1)(b) of the Regulations uses the present tense when requiring that the marriage be genuine, proving the genuineness of his relationship today would be enough to meet the test under subsection 4(1). This is not the case. In Gill, Chief Justice Crampton summarized as follows the approach in assessing marriages pursuant to subsection 4(1):

[29]      […] A plain reading of section 4 of the Regulations reflects that these are two distinct tests. If a finding that a marriage is genuine precluded the possibility of a finding that the marriage was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the IRPA, the latter test would be superfluous. This would offend the presumption against statutory surplusage. (R v Proulx, 2000 SCC 5, at para 28, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61).

[16]           There are two distinct tests under paragraphs 4(1)(a) and (b) of the Regulations, and either test can dispose of an application. Finding that a marriage is genuine does not negate the requirement that the marriage must not have been entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring a status. In order to be considered a spouse, the marriage needs to be genuine and the relationship must not have been entered into primarily for immigration purposes (Burton at para 28; Khan v Canada (Minister of citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 320 [Khan] at para 16; Gill at paras 29-30). Subsection 4(1) makes it clear that “[e]ither finding precludes the spouse from obtaining the necessary visa to live with her husband in Canada” (Khan at para 16; Singh v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 1077 at para 5).

(2)               The IAD reasonably assessed the evidence

[17]           Mr. Nguyen submits that, in the present case, the IAD did not take into consideration all of his circumstances nor the various positive factors and evidence in support of his relationship with Mrs. Truong Nguyen. He referred more specifically to their shared country of origin and language, their Vietnamese cultural, ethnic and religious commonality and compatibility, their child, phone bills showing communications, a life insurance policy, proof of financial support, and his trips back to Vietnam since 2009. Mr. Nguyen further pleads that inconsistencies in testimonies do not prove an absence of a bona fide marital relationship and that “inconsistencies […] would represent a thin foundation for rejecting all of the other evidence favouring the genuineness of [a] marriage” (Sandhu v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 1303 [Sandhu] at para 6). Mr. Nguyen thus submits that the IAD erred in ignoring “significant evidence of a positive, genuine relationship by unduly focusing on minor inconsistencies” (Amayeanvbo v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 621 at para 45).

[18]           I do not agree with Mr. Nguyen’s submissions.

[19]           The IAD assessed all the evidence, and dismissed Mr. Nguyen’s appeal for several reasons. These included the facts that Mr. Nguyen did not provide evidence as to how his relationship with Mrs. Truong Nguyen evolved before they met in person; that he previously sponsored someone else as his wife but could not remember her name during the oral hearing; that his first wife arrived in Canada when Mr. Nguyen was meeting Mrs. Truong Nguyen for the first time in Vietnam; that Mr. Nguyen claimed that he did not know his first wife’s plan to come to Canada; that there were discrepancies between the testimonies of Mr. Nguyen and Mrs. Truong Nguyen regarding the knowledge of Mr. Nguyen’s first marriage and the proposal date; and that the close friend who acted as a witness did not have knowledge of Mr. Nguyen’s first marriage. In addition, the IAD correctly pointed out that, even though the presence of a child creates a presumption that a relationship is genuine, that presumption can be rebutted. This is what happened here, as the IAD voiced many credibility concerns.

[20]           I pause to observe that this is not a case where the adverse credibility findings made by the IAD are not supported by the evidence on the record. Mr. Nguyen indeed acknowledged many of the deficiencies and contradictions. This situation is therefore quite different from the Sandhu and Saroya v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 414 cases cited by Mr. Nguyen.

[21]           This Court owes deference to the IAD on issues of credibility. This applies even more so in a case like this, where people seeking to deceive the immigration authorities would want to make their marriage look genuine. As recently indicated by the Court, “assessing the genuineness of a marriage is a challenging task at the best of times”, in a context where people “who are intent on committing a form of deceit to gain the highly valuable status of Canadian permanent residence will conduct themselves to make the relationship look outwardly genuine, when it is not” (Bercasio at para 23).

[22]           I am mindful of the fact that, as pointed out by counsel for Mr. Nguyen, the IAD should not turn its review into a memory test (Shabab v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 872 at para 39). However, singling out conflicting and incoherent evidence and questioning an applicant on it, as the IAD did here, does not amount to that.

[23]           Contrary to Mr. Nguyen’s submissions, this is also not a situation where “the evidence omitted from any discussion in the reasons appears squarely to contradict the agency's finding of fact” (Cepeda-Gutierrez v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1998 CanLII 8667 (FC), [1998] FCJ No 1425 (QL) [Cepeda-Gutierrez] at para 17). It is well recognized that a decision-maker is presumed to have weighed and considered all the evidence presented to it unless the contrary is shown (Florea v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1993] FCJ no 598 (FCA) at para 1). A failure to mention a particular piece of evidence does not mean that it was ignored (Newfoundland Nurses at para 16). It is only when a tribunal is silent on evidence clearly pointing to an opposite conclusion that the Court may intervene and infer that the tribunal overlooked the contradictory evidence when making its finding of fact (Ozdemir v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2001 FCA 331 at paras 9-10; Cepeda-Gutierrez at paras 16-17). This is not the case here.

[24]           Assessing the genuineness of a marriage is a highly factual determination at the heart of the IAD’s expertise and functions. Even though the Court might have evaluated the evidence differently, it should not intervene if a decision is justifiable, transparent and intelligible and falls within the confines of possible, acceptable outcomes. I find that this is clearly the case for the IAD’s decision.



(3)               The IAD did not misconstrue facts

[25]           Mr. Nguyen further submits that the IAD erred when it indicated that he had not “travelled to Vietnam to see his son since his first birthday in 2013 even though he made more regular visits prior to his birth”, and when it determined that “very little evidence of financial support” was provided for the period prior to the birth of their child. Mr. Nguyen claims that these findings of fact are not accurate, as he provided proof that he visited his son in January 2014 and that he financially supported his spouse and her son from a previous marriage prior to the birth of his biological son, through 17 money transfers totalling $6,600.

[26]           I am not persuaded that these excerpts amount to a misconstruction of facts justifying the intervention of this Court. In fact, Mr. Nguyen’s arguments instead reflect a narrow reading of two passages in the IAD’s decision, divorced from the overall context of the panel’s analysis.

[27]           I acknowledge that the last time Mr. Nguyen effectively travelled to Vietnam was in early 2014. However, what the IAD said was that Mr. Nguyen had not travelled since his son’s first birthday, which occurred in December 2013. The central fact here is that Mr. Nguyen had not, at the time of the IAD’s hearing, seen his son since his first birthday. While the words chosen by the IAD may not be as clear as they could have been, it is obvious that the panel was aware of Mr. Nguyen’s visit in January 2014. I find no material error in the statement picked out by Mr. Nguyen, sufficient to render the IAD’s decision unreasonable. Regarding the financial support, I observe that from the birth of his son up to October 2015 (a period of a little less than three years), Mr. Nguyen sent approximately $18,700 to his wife. It was thus open to the IAD, and certainly within the sphere of reasonableness, to qualify as “very little evidence of financial support” what was provided by Mr. Nguyen prior to his son’s birth (i.e., $6,600), given that the amount sent to Mrs. Truong Nguyen tripled after his son’s birth.

(4)               The IAD rightly considered Mr. Nguyen’s first marriage

[28]           Mr. Nguyen then argues that the IAD focused on irrelevant considerations when it referred to his previous marriage with his first wife, and unreasonably drew a negative credibility inference from it with respect to the genuineness of his present marriage.

[29]           I am of the view that Mr. Nguyen’s claim in this respect is ill-founded. As acknowledged by counsel for Mr. Nguyen at the hearing before this Court, an applicant’s immigration history and past sponsorship are relevant to a decision by the IAD under subsection 4(1). It is in fact recognized that immigration history can be assessed in determining if a marriage meets the requirements of the Regulations (Aburime at para 23; Enright v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 209 at para 45). The IAD can indeed consider a large number of factors in determining the genuineness of a marriage (Ouk v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 FC 891 at para 13; Khera v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 FC 632 at para 10). It was thus reasonable for the IAD to factor this prior marriage of convenience in its analysis.

[30]           Mr. Nguyen complains that this finding clouded the IAD’s approach to the rest of the evidence and unduly tainted its analysis. I disagree. The IAD could certainly not ignore this element given its direct relevance to Mr. Nguyen’s application for spousal sponsorship, and nowhere do I see in the IAD’s reasons any indication that the panel blinded itself to the evidence before it because of Mr. Nguyen’s first marriage.

(5)               Conclusion on reasonableness

[31]           In essence, Mr. Nguyen is inviting the Court to reweigh the evidence that he has presented before the IAD. In conducting a reasonableness review of factual findings, it is not the role of the Court to do so or to reassess the relative importance given by the decision-maker to any relevant factor or piece of evidence. If the findings provide sufficient justification and rationality in light of the totality of the evidence before the decision-maker, a reviewing court should not substitute its own view of a preferable outcome.

[32]           True, the IAD’s reasons could perhaps have been more explicit and articulate, and more precisely worded. But I am not persuaded that the decision reaches the level of unreasonableness or lacks intelligibility. The test this Court has to apply is not whether the decision satisfies the expectations of Mr. Nguyen; the test is the reasonableness of the decision.

[33]           Reasons are to be read as a whole, in conjunction with the record (Agraira v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36 at para 53; Construction Labour Relations v Driver Iron Inc, 2012 SCC 65 at para 3). A judicial review is not a “line-by-line treasure hunt for error” (Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada, Local 30 v Irving Pulp & Paper, Ltd, 2013 SCC 34 at para 54). The Court should instead approach the reasons with a view to “understanding, not to puzzling over every possible inconsistency, ambiguity or infelicity of expression” (Ragupathy v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FCA 151 at para 15). When read as a whole, the IAD’s decision is reasonable and does not fall outside the realm of acceptable, possible outcomes. The IAD properly assessed all the necessary factors and provided an analysis of the evidence presented. The intervention of this Court is not warranted.

B.                 Were the IAD’s Reasons Inadequate?

[34]           Mr. Nguyen also submits that the IAD’s decision, which is only three pages long with an actual analysis of merely seven paragraphs, is simplistic and demonstrates insufficient consideration of key evidence. He relies on the Court’s decision in Javed, where it was stated that “[t]he failure to provide meaningful or adequate reasons for the decision is a breach of the duty of procedural fairness” (Javed v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FC 1458 at para 22).

[35]           This, in my view, is an inaccurate statement of the law on adequacy of reasons.

[36]           Sufficiency of reasons is not measured by the pound. No matter the number of words used by a decision-maker or how concise a decision may be, the test is whether the reasons are clear and intelligible and explain to the Court and the parties why the decision was reached. Reasons are sufficient if they “allow the reviewing court to understand why the tribunal made its decision and permit it to determine whether the conclusion is within the range of acceptable outcomes” (Newfoundland Nurses at para 16). In order to provide adequate reasons, “the decision maker must set out its findings of fact and the principal evidence upon which those findings were based”, as well as “address the major point in issue” and “reflect consideration of the main relevant factors” (VIA Rail Canada Inc v National Transportation Agency, 2000 CanLII 16275 (FCA), [2001] 2 FCR 25 at para 22). This is exactly what the IAD did.

[37]           As I explained in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Abdulghafoor, 2015 FC 1020 at paras 30-36 and Al-Katanani v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 1053 [Al-Katanani] at para 32, the law relating to the sufficiency of reasons in administrative decision-making has evolved substantially since Dunsmuir. In Newfoundland Nurses, the Supreme Court provided guidance on how to approach situations where decision-makers provide brief or limited reasons. Reasons need not be fulsome or perfect, and need not address all of the evidence or arguments put forward by a party or in the record (Newfoundland Nurses at paras 16 and 18). Reasonableness, not perfection, is the standard. Even where the reasons for the decision are brief, or poorly written, the Court should defer to the decision-maker’s weighing of the evidence, as long as it is able to understand why the decision was made (Al-Katanani at para 32).

[38]           Reasons do not need to be lengthy either. Even a sentence or two can be enough to provide adequate reasons (Vancouver International Airport Authority v Public Service Alliance of Canada, 2010 FCA 158 at para 25). Short as they may be, reasons will be sufficient if they “allow the reviewing court to assess the validity of the decision” (Lake v Canada (Minister of Justice), 2008 SCC 23 at para 46).

[39]           The IAD’s reasons enable me to understand how the panel reached its conclusion as they explain why Mr. Nguyen and Mrs. Truong Nguyen do not meet the requirements of subsection 4(1) of the Regulations, and there is factual foundation for reaching this conclusion. There is no inadequacy of reasons here.

IV.            Conclusion

[40]           The IAD’s refusal of Mr. Nguyen’s appeal on the ground that his marriage is not genuine and that the couple has entered into their relationship primarily for the purpose of obtaining immigration status represents a reasonable outcome based on the law and the evidence before the panel. On a standard of reasonableness, it suffices if the decision subject to judicial review falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law. This is the case here. In addition, the IAD provided adequate reasons. Therefore, I must dismiss Mr. Nguyen’s application for judicial review.

[41]           Neither party has proposed a question of general importance for me to certify. I agree there is none.




JUDGMENT

THIS COURT’S JUDGMENT is that:

1.      The application for judicial review is dismissed, without costs;

2.      No question of general importance is certified.

BETWEEN:




KARMJEET KAUR TIWANA




Applicant




and




THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION




Respondent

JUDGMENT AND REASONS

I.                  Introduction

[1]               This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Immigration Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board [IAD], dated December 21, 2015, dismissing the Applicant’s spousal sponsorship appeal on the doctrine of res judicata.

II.               Background

[2]               The Applicant, Karmjeet Kaur Tiwana, was born in India and was granted permanent residence in Canada in 2005 under a spousal sponsorship by her former husband. Within one month of landing, the Applicant separated from her former husband and divorced him several months later.

[3]               In November 2008, the Applicant first met and married her second husband in India. In June 2009, the Applicant’s second spouse applied for permanent residence in Canada.

[4]               After conducting an interview with the Applicant and her spouse, a visa officer [the Officer] refused the permanent residence application pursuant to subsection 4(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227 [the Regulations], which provides that a person will not be considered a “spouse” under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act ( S.C. 2001, c. 27) [Act] where: (a) the marriage was entered primarily for the purposes of immigration; or (b) the marriage is not genuine. Though these are distinct findings, the Officer was satisfied both were met in this case. The Officer noted the following concerns:

the spouse’s explanation why the marriage was arranged far from his village was not credible;
the spouse lacked knowledge of simple things about the Applicant – he could not immediately name the Applicant’s parents and named them incorrectly, he provided inconsistent evidence regarding the identification of the Applicant’s maternal uncle, he could not state the village of the Applicant’s relatives even though he purportedly visited them after the marriage, and he was not knowledgeable about the Applicant’s employment;
the spouse’s description of where the Applicant lives and with whom was inconsistent with the Sponsor Questionnaire; and
the telephone bills submitted were for the telephone of the spouse’s younger paternal uncle and the mail was addressed to this same uncle, whose name was later struck out and changed to the Applicant’s.

[5]               The Applicant appealed this decision to the IAD, which was dismissed in April of 2012, under subsection 4(1) of the Regulations [the Previous Decision]. The IAD noted in this decision that “at the time of the February 2012 hearing, the Appellant was pregnant… [t]he panel does not have sufficient reason to doubt that the Appellant became pregnant through her relationship with the Applicant”. Though the IAD noted that a pregnancy is strong presumptive proof that the claimed marital relationship is genuine (citing Gill v Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration), 2010 FC 122 at para 8), it nevertheless found the following facts inconsistent with a genuine ongoing marital relationship:

the spouse’s testimony contradicted the Applicant’s regarding the development of their relationship and marriage negotiations;
the spouse did not provide a credible explanation for why the marriage festivities were held so far away from his home;
the spouse demonstrated a lack of knowledge of the Applicant;
in attempting to explain the spouse’s incorrect and inconsistent testimony, the Applicant alleged her spouse suffers from memory problems, yet provided no corroborating evidence;
the spouse did not provide an accurate account of when he learned of the pregnancy;
the Applicant had not discussed tentative plans for maternity leave or return to work with her spouse;
evidence of savings and insurance was of limited value, as all documents are post-refusal; and
the spouse has family members residing in Canada, which further suggests the marriage was entered into for immigration purposes.

[6]               Justice Anne Mactavish denied leave for judicial review of this decision on October 29, 2012.

[7]               In October 2013, the Applicant again applied to sponsor her spouse, which was refused on December 8, 2014, pursuant to subsection 4(1) of the Regulations. Though the Applicant and her spouse had been invited for an interview, they did not show. The Applicant appealed the refusal to the IAD, which is the decision currently under review [the Decision].

[8]               The IAD dismissed the appeal on the basis of res judicata and issue estoppel – the legal doctrine meant to preclude continued litigation of a case that has already been finally decided on the same issues and between the same parties.

[9]               The IAD noted the two-step process governing issue estoppel set out in by the Supreme Court of Canada in Danyluk v Ainsworth Technologies Inc, 2001 SCC 44 at paragraph 33 [Danyluk]: first, determine whether the pre-conditions of issue estoppel apply; and second, determine whether applying res judicata would result in an injustice.

[10]           Having considered the evidence and the law on res judicata, the IAD was satisfied that the necessary preconditions set out in Danyluk, above, were met: (i) the same issue has been previously decided in the earlier proceeding; (ii) the Previous Decision was final; and (iii) the parties to the present proceeding are the same as the parties to which the Previous Decision applied (Danyluk, at para 25).

[11]           At the appeal, the Applicant had argued that the doctrine of res judicata should not apply because there is new evidence consisting of the birth of her son, further trips to India to visit her spouse, and evidence of continuous contact between the couple.

[12]           The IAD noted that the presence of decisive, fresh evidence that could not have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence in the first proceeding constitutes a “special circumstance” which may serve as a valid basis for refusing to apply the doctrine of res judicata.

[13]           Upon careful consideration of the new evidence, the IAD was not satisfied that the evidence amounted to “decisive new evidence” that is demonstrably capable of altering the result of the first proceeding.

[14]           The IAD noted that though the birth of the Applicant’s son in August 2012, is new evidence, the Previous Decision took into account that the Applicant was pregnant, and did not have concerns the spouse was not the father of the child. Though the best interests of the child may not have been addressed in the Previous Decision, the pregnancy was one factor considered in the overall assessment of the sponsorship appeal.

[15]           Moreover, the documentary evidence was insufficient to overcome the concerns and discrepancies raised in the Previous Decision. Other than the birth of a child, the documentary evidence simply aims to show that since the Applicant and her spouse are still together, the marriage is genuine. The IAD reasoned that if such evidence were considered “decisive new evidence”, these types of proceedings would lack finality, as persons described under subsection 4(1) of the Regulations would simply attempt to remain together overtime.

[16]           While the birth of a child is a significant factor, it is one of many considered in determining whether the spouse falls under subsection 4(1) of the Regulations. The IAD found that alone, it does not alter the Previous Decision or overcome concerns of the most recent decision from the Officer, dated December 2014.

[17]           The IAD cited Chotai v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 1335 [Chotai], as support for its view the evidence did not preclude the application of res judicata, as it did not address both factors under subsection 4(1) of the Act. In that case, quite similar to the Applicant’s, Justice Michael Phelan wrote:

19  The Applicant’s position can be summarised as follows: the new evidence (such of it as is truly new) shows that the relationship is real. Since it shows the continuum of a relationship said to be one of convenience, it shows that the relationship is genuine and rebuts the original decision. The thesis is that the longer a couple stays together, the more genuine the relationship.

20  The issue in this case is not whether the relationship has become genuine. Section 4 of the Regulations does not speak to the state of the relationship from time to time but whether it “was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act” (emphasis added). It speaks to the state of the relationship, its purpose at the time at which it was entered. Subparagraph (b) (“is not genuine”) speaks to the state of the relationship at the time it is being considered. However, the decision is grounded in subparagraph (a), not subparagraph (b).

21  As such, the “fresh evidence” must be evaluated with a view to whether it is sufficient to address and materially change the original decision. This is the distinguishing feature between this case and Sami v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration), 2012 FC 539, 215 A.C.W.S. (3d) 190 (F.C.), where the fresh evidence addressed the IAD’s initial concerns.

[18]           The IAD concluded that the doctrine of issue estoppel applied on these facts, as whether the Applicant’s spouse is caught by subsection 4(1) of the Regulations has already been assessed by two decisions: by the IAD in the Previous Decision, and by the Federal Court, denying leave.

III.            Issue

[19]           The only issue in this case is whether it was reasonable for the IAD to determine that the new evidence was not decisive, such that it was capable of altering the results of the Previous Decision.

IV.            Standard of Review

[20]           Whether the birth of a child and evidence regarding the ongoing relationship between the Applicant and her spouse constitutes decisive new evidence capable of altering the results of the previous decision, and thus whether res judicata and issue estoppel ought to have been applied, is reviewed on the standard of reasonableness (Dhaliwal v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1182 at para 7 [Dhaliwal]; Chotai, above at para 16).

[21]           Any issues of procedural fairness are reviewed on a standard of correctness.

V.               Analysis

[22]           Neither party disputes that the principle of res judicata arises; rather, they dispute whether it should be applied. The Applicant’s position is that the IAD improperly analyzed the new evidence, finding it insufficient to alter the previous findings, which renders its Decision unreasonable.

[23]           First, she submits that the reasoning applied by this Court in Sandhu v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 834 [Sandhu], applies to the case at bar. In Sandhu, above, Justice Luc Martineau found that evidence of a continuing relationship, further trips to India, and the birth of a child have been held to be fresh, decisive evidence in previous judicial reviews of spousal-sponsorship applications, and that the IAD is required to address why it does not constitute such evidence beyond simply adopting the reasons of the previous panel.

[24]           In this case, the Applicant claims that the IAD simply adopted previous findings and failed to provide any analysis explaining why those findings are not overcome by this evidence.

[25]           Second, the Applicant argues that the IAD gave insufficient consideration to the birth of a child, which has been affirmed by this Court to be an example of special circumstances and significant new evidence warranting the non-application of issue estoppel. The IAD merely acknowledged the existence of a child, but did not assess relevant facts, including that the Applicant and her husband have jointly parented their child for over three years.

[26]           Third, the Applicant submits that the IAD erred by disregarding evidence of the Applicant and her spouse’s ongoing commitment, which demonstrates a genuine marriage that has been tested over time and through the adversity of separation.

[27]           The Applicant also claims that in its reasons, the IAD erroneously found that evidence of an ongoing and committed relationship cannot be used as proof of the genuineness of the marriage and to support the fact it was not entered into for the primary purpose of immigration. The Decision states:

If this were to be allowed, then persons who are described pursuant to subsection 4(1) of the Regulations would just attempt to remain together overtime with a view of showing that subsection 4(1) of the Regulations does not apply; doing so would render cases in this profile as indefinite not bringing finality.

[28]           According to the Applicant, this reasoning is flawed and runs contrary to this Court’s jurisprudence. Evidence of a continuing long-term relationship has been found to be an indicator that the relationship is genuine, and is capable of altering the original panel’s finding that the marriage had primarily been entered into for immigration purposes (Sami v Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration), 2012 FC 539 at paras 72-79 [Sami]; Sandhu, at paras 13, 16).

[29]           Finally, while the IAD could have assessed the evidence and found it did not overcome the original determination, the Applicant claims it was not open to the IAD to refuse to consider the evidence at all.

[30]           In my view, the IAD correctly applied the preconditions to issue estoppel and reasonably concluded res judicata was applicable in the circumstances. The IAD assessed whether the evidence was sufficient to alter the Previous Decision, and reasonably determined it did not.

[31]           The IAD did not simply affirm previous findings. Rather, the IAD “carefully considered” the evidence, and found it was not decisive new evidence sufficient to overcome the Officer’s concerns. The new evidence consisted primarily of the birth of the Applicant’s son, and evidence relating to the Applicant’s fourth and fifth trips to India in 2013 and 2015 (i.e. passport stamps, and few photos of the family together). The IAD reasoned that the pregnancy had in fact been taken into account by the IAD previously, but that it had not influenced its ultimate conclusion under subsection 4(1). Further, the IAD did not find the other evidence capable of altering the Previous Decision, as it failed to address the former evidentiary discrepancies and credibility issues that suggested the marriage was entered into for immigration purposes and was not genuine.

[32]           Though the type of evidence presented by the Applicant has before been held to constitute fresh, decisive evidence, each case is unique and must be decided on its particular facts. As Justice Catherine Kane held in Ping v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 1121 at paragraph 24 [Ping], “it is not the nature of the evidence that is determinative but how that evidence addresses or overcomes the earlier findings”. Though the Applicant relies heavily on Sandhu to suggest the type of evidence she currently presents is decisive new evidence, as stated by Justice Martineau at paragraph 15 of that decision:

On the facts of some cases, the birth of a child may be sufficient to warrant the non-application of res judicata. However, where the facts on which the previous decision was decided very strongly support the finding that the primary purpose of a marriage is to acquire status under the Act, it is less likely that this will be sufficient. In order to be decisive new evidence, the evidence must genuinely affect the analysis or evaluation of the intention. Evidence which simply bolsters or attempts to create the intention after the fact will be insufficient (Gharu, above, at para 17). What makes this case different from other cases is the admission made by the respondent that the new evidence establishes the genuineness of the marriage.

[Emphasis added]

[33]           It should be noted that both the Officer and the IAD in its Previous Decision found serious problems with Applicant and her spouse’s inconsistent testimony, lack of knowledge of each other, their credibility, and the bona fide nature of their marriage. This led the IAD to conclude that both subsection 4(1) factors had been met. While the type of evidence adduced by the Applicant has been held to be fresh, decisive evidence in previous judicial reviews of spousal-sponsorship applications, I also note that equally so has it been found not to be (Anttal v Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration), 2008 FC 30 at para 19; Ping, above, at para 29). The analysis is contextual and fact-dependant.

[34]           For instance, in Sandhu, unlike the case before me, the applicant was not pregnant at the time the first IAD appeal was dismissed. Thus, that fact was “new evidence” not considered by the IAD in the first decision that was found to change the previous analysis.

[35]           In the present Decision, the IAD stated that evidence of a continuing relationship cannot be new evidence capable of altering the first decision. Although this finding runs contrary to decisions of this Court, I do not find this error was determinative, or that it affected the overall reasonableness of the Decision. This is because the IAD considered the alternative, and did not simply ignore the documentary evidence of a continuing relationship. At paragraph 16, the IAD stated:

Even if the Panel did determine the documentation to be new evidence demonstrably capable of altering the decision of the first appeal, which it does not, the documentary evidence has not been able to overcome the concerns and discrepancies addressed in the decision of Member N.S. Paul of April 24, 2012.

[36]           Moreover, though occurrences subsequent to a marriage may be relevant to an assessment under subsection 4(1) of the Regulations, as Chief Justice Paul Crampton held in Gill v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1522 at paragraphs 32 and 33:

32  … such evidence is not necessarily determinative, and it is not necessarily unreasonable for the IAD to fail to explicitly consider and discuss such evidence.

33  This is because, in contrast to the present tense focus of the first of the two tests set forth in section 4 of the Regulations, which requires an assessment of whether the impugned marriage “is not genuine,” the focus of the second of those tests requires an assessment of whether the marriage “was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act” (emphasis added). Accordingly, in assessing whether the latter test is satisfied, the focus must be upon the intentions of both parties to the marriage at the time of the marriage.

[37]           In the case at hand, evidence of occurrences post-dating the marriage does not speak to the nature of the marriage at the time it was entered into (Chotai, at para 21), and it was not unreasonable for the IAD to find that evidence was unable to overcome concerns and discrepancies noted in the Previous Decision.

[38]           As well, the Applicant’s assertion that the IAD’s refusal to provide the Applicant an opportunity to present viva voce testimony was unreasonable and procedurally unfair is without merit. Res judicata is a pre-hearing matter that, if applied, precludes a full hearing. The IAD has the authority to summarily dismiss an appeal, without a full hearing on the merits, when an appellant seeks to re-litigate on essentially the same evidence (Kaloti v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2000 CanLII 17123 (FCA), [2000] 3 FCR 390 (FCA) at paras 9, 10 [Kaloti]; Hamid v Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration), 2007 FC 220 at para 18). As well, the Applicant and her spouse have had the opportunity to present viva voce testimony in the first instance, which led to the IAD concluding as it did, in particular due to discrepancies, credibility issues and other testimony that the IAD found inconsistent with a genuine marriage that was not entered into for immigration purposes.

[39]           Furthermore, while the Applicant criticizes the Decision for failing to analyse the best interests of the child, under sections 63 and 65 of the Act, the IAD does not have jurisdiction to consider humanitarian and compassionate considerations arising on an appeal from a family class application. The IAD may only allow the appeal based on sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds (thereby taking into account the child’s best interests) once it has decided that the foreign national is a member of the family class and that their sponsor is a “sponsor” within the meaning of the Regulations (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Chen, 2014 FC 262 at para 14; Fang v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 733 at paras 23-34). Given the preliminary and threshold finding of res judicata, the Applicant’s spouse is not a member of the family class.

[40]           I also find that the reasons provided are sufficient: the IAD explained why the doctrine of res judicata applied and why there was inadequate evidence to overcome the Previous Decision. A decision-maker is not required to make an explicit finding on each argument and constituent element, however subordinate, leading to its final conclusion.

[41]           The IAD’s assessment of the new evidence was reasonable. The IAD considered both the child’s birth and the limited documentation of an ongoing relationship, but found neither sufficient to offset the factors weighing against the Applicant. The IAD also reasonably found there was no evidence of unfairness or injustice so as to warrant exception to the doctrine of res judicata and issue estoppel, which apply to promote finality and prevent the re-litigation of issues already determined. Accordingly, I would dismiss the application.




JUDGMENT

THIS COURT’S JUDGMENT is that:

1.                  The application is dismissed;

BETWEEN:




MOHAMMED ESSA NANJI

and




THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION




Respondent

JUDGMENT AND REASONS

[1] This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Immigration Appeal Division [IAD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada appealing the decision of a visa officer denying the Applicant’s application to sponsor his spouse for permanent residence in Canada.

Background

[2] The Applicant, Mohammed Essa Nanji (the Appellant before the IAD), is a 50-year-old naturalized citizen of Canada. He sought to sponsor his current wife, Rehana Kausar (the Applicant before the IAD) [Spouse], who is a citizen of Pakistan, for permanent residence in Canada. This is the Applicant’s third marriage.

[3] In 2002, the Applicant married his first wife in India. He claims that the marriage was a religious marriage and was not registered with the government. Further, he claims that in 2004 he and his first wife were divorced by verbal agreement in front of a Qazi in Mumbai, on the consent of both parties. The Applicant married his second wife in August 2006. His second wife obtained a judgement of divorce from the Family Court in Mumbai dated October 30, 2013 [Divorce Order].

[4] On January 23, 2015, the Applicant married his third wife. He filed a sponsorship application in July 2015. That application was refused in June 2017 on the basis that the Spouse was not a member of the family class because the Applicant was the spouse of another person (his first wife) at the time he and his Spouse married. A second sponsorship application was filed by the Applicant on February 11, 2019. On March 9, 2020, a procedural fairness letter was sent to the Applicant requesting, among other things, further information and documentation of his divorce from his first wife. The Applicant responded to the procedural fairness letter on March 27, 2020, submitting that his first marriage was not legally valid in India and, therefore, he was not able to obtain a legal divorce. The Applicant’s second sponsorship application was denied on September 30, 2020 on the basis that the Applicant had failed to establish that he was divorced from his first wife at the time he married his Spouse.

[5] The Applicant appealed to the IAD. On November 23, 2020, the Applicant provided the IAD with a copy of a divorce certificate issued on November 11, 2020 by the Office of the Chief Qazi of Kausa, Mumra, Davla, Thane [Divorce Certificate]. By decision dated March 30, 2021, the IAD denied the Applicant’s appeal. That decision is the subject of this application for judicial review.

Decision Under Review

[6] The IAD found that the Applicant’s divorce from his first wife was not legal under Canadian law. His first divorce was verbal Islamic divorce by khula, which is valid in India since registration of the divorce with civil authorities is not mandatory. However, it found that the lack of judicial or other state oversight of the divorce rendered it invalid in Canada. Therefore, the Applicant was not free to marry his Spouse under Canadian law and their marriage is not legally valid. This meant that the Spouse is not a member of the family class.

[7] The IAD also declined the Applicant’s alternate request that the IAD exercise its discretion to consider a “Tabesh conversion” (Tabesh v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 CanLII 76104 (CA IRB)) on the basis that a Tabesh conversion is not appropriate because the applicant was the spouse of another person when the marriage to their sponsor took place.

[8] The IAD held that the Spouse is not a member of the family class and was therefore inadmissible pursuant to subsection 11(1) of the IRPA and dismissed the appeal.

Issues and Standard of Review

[9] The sole issue in the matter is whether the IAD’s decision was reasonable.

[10] The parties submit, and I agree, that review of the merits of the IAD’s decision attracts the reasonableness standard of review (Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 at paras 10, 23, 25 [Vavilov]). Applying this standard, the reviewing court asks whether the decision bears the hallmarks of reasonableness – justification, transparency and intelligibility – and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision (Vavilov at para 99).

Analysis
Applicant’s Position

[11] The Applicant submits that the IAD’s decision is unreasonable because it is contradictory and internally inconsistent. The IAD stated that Shariah law applied to both the Applicant’s first marriage and divorce under The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, a law of India. Therefore, no formal registration of the marriage or divorce with a civil authority was required in order to be recognized in India. The IAD also stated that the Applicant’s Shariah divorce from his first wife would not be recognized in Canada because it lacked recognition by a foreign tribunal or state authority. The Applicant submits that while the IAD recognized the marriage without documentation because it was recognized as valid in India, it unreasonably refused to accept the validity of the divorce on the same basis. Further, if formal recognition was required of both the marriage and the divorce, then the Applicant’s first marriage was technically not legally valid. Accordingly, it was not necessary for him to provide further evidence of the laws of India concerning his religious marriage. However, the Applicant argues that the IAD unreasonably refused to accept this submission.

[12] The Applicant also submits that section 22 of the Divorce Act does not require that a divorce only be recognized on the basis of documentation from a tribunal or government authority. The IAD acknowledged that there is civil authority in India to recognize unregistered marriages or divorces. Therefore, the Applicant does not need to provide evidence of such formal recognition, such as from a court or government office, for his divorce to be legally valid. In that regard, the Applicant submits that the IAD’s reading of Amin v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 FC 168 [Amin] is unreasonably narrow. Further, he submits that he provided an affidavit from a lawyer stating their inability to obtain a certificate of divorce from the courts (the 100 Rupee affidavit of Aisha Shaikh affirmed on June 30, 2018 [Shaikh Affidavit]), as well as a certificate of divorce from a religious official (the Divorce Certificate). According to him, the IAD failed to consider the specific facts of his case and unreasonably rejected the validity of his divorce.

[13] The Applicant also submits that his refusal was based on the formal validity of his (current) marriage, thereby creating a duty on the IAD to grant a Tabesh conversion, that is to consider whether his Spouse could alternatively be sponsored as either a conjugal or common-law partner. As the IAD did not accept his first divorce to be valid, then it should also have considered his first marriage not to be valid. On that basis, the Applicant was not married to his first wife when he married his Spouse and should not be considered the spouse of another person during his 6-year relationship with his Spouse. In his view, it was accordingly unreasonable for the IAD not to exercise its discretion to convert the application to a conjugal analysis.

Respondent’s Position

[14] The Respondent submits that the IAD did not err in finding that the Applicant’s divorce by verbal agreement was not legal under Canadian law. The IAD found that a key factor in determining whether a divorce will be recognized under section 22 of the Divorce Act is whether there is formal recognition of the divorce by a foreign tribunal or other state authority. In the absence of such evidence, it was open to the IAD to find that the Applicant had not shown that his divorce was legally valid. Contrary to the Applicant’s submission, Amin supports the IAD’s finding with respect to the importance of official oversight of a divorce in order for it to be valid in Canada (citing Amin at para 20).

[15] The Respondent submits that the IAD considered the Shaikh Affidavit, in which a lawyer in India stated that she could not obtain the divorce documentation from the government offices or court of law due to the lapse of time. Nor did the Affidavit provide details of the applicable law of India. Accordingly, it was open to the IAD to find the Affidavit insufficient to establish that the Applicant cannot obtain official documentation concerning his marriage or his divorce. As to the Divorce Certificate, the Respondent submits that the IAD reasonably found that this did not establish the legality of the Applicant’s divorce in Canada as it was issued by a religious office and not a state or judicial authority.

[16] The Respondent submits that while the Applicant asserted that his first marriage was not legal in India, the IAD noted that Shariah law applied to both the Applicant’s marriage and divorce and, therefore, formal registration with a civil authority was not required for them to be recognized in India. Without evidence as to the laws of India pertaining to his religious marriage or divorce, it was open to the IAD to find that the available evidence indicated that the Applicant was legally married to his first wife and that he had not established that he would be unable to obtain divorce documents from a government authority due to the manner of his first marriage.

[17] The Respondent submits that the Tabesh conversion is not available where the sponsor was the spouse of another person at the time of their marriage (Tabesh at para 25). While within the IAD there is divided opinion regarding the authority to make a Tabesh conversion (citing Tang v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 973 [Tang] at para 32 as well as various IAD decisions), the IAD reasonably found that it was not appropriate to exercise its discretion to effect a Tabesh conversion where section 117(9)(c)(i) of the IRP Regulations applies.

Analysis

[18] At issue before both the visa officer and the IAD was whether the Applicant had established that his divorce from his first wife was legally valid in Canada and, accordingly, whether his marriage to his Spouse was legally valid in Canada.

[19] By way of background, I note that the procedural fairness letter issued to the Applicant’s Spouse advised that the visa officer had concerns, among other things, about the validity of the Spouse’s marriage to the Applicant. This concern arose because, based on the submitted documents (the Shaikh Affidavit), the Applicant’s divorce from his first wife may not have taken place or been valid for Canadian immigration purposes at the time the Spouse married the Applicant.

[20] The Shaikh Affidavit states that the Applicant and his first wife married and divorced (by consent) in accordance with the customs, rites and rituals prevailing in the Islamic religion amongst Muslims in India. The Affidavit states that the affiant tried to obtain the declaration of divorce from the “Hon’ble Court of Law”. However, as the marriage was solemnized per the customs, rites and rituals prevailing amongst Muslims, the affiant was unable to get a Marriage Registration Certificate in “any of the Government Department”. Since the Applicant and his first wife divorced by mutual consent and out of Court, the affiant could not get a declaration of divorce from any Court of Law within the respective jurisdiction and more particularly at the Hon’ble Family Court, at Bandra, Mumbai. The affiant states that she personally visited “the respective Government Offices” and Court of Law but no document in respect of the Applicant and his first wife’s divorce “is available on their records due to the lapse of time”.

[21] In response to the procedural fairness letter, the Applicant’s immigration consultant submitted that India requires all marriages to be registered in order to be considered a valid marriage but that the Applicant and his first wife did not complete that process. Instead they married “within the Islamic laws and regulations and divorced similarly”. The immigration consultant stated that there was no record that the marriage was registered. Since the Applicant and his first wife “were not legally married,” they could not obtain a legal divorce. The Applicant’s first marriage “was not registered or legal”. The immigration consultant attached an unsigned and unsworn statement of fact from the Applicant dated March 27, 2020, in support of this position.

[22] Subsequently, in support of the Applicant’s appeal to the IAD, the Applicant’s immigration consultant submitted the Divorce Certificate. This was issued based on the request of the Applicant through his advocate, Aisha Shaikh, who provided the same Affidavit in support of that request, as well as a November 5, 2020, letter from the Applicant. The Divorce Certificate notes that the Shaikh Affidavit confirmed that the Divorce Certificate was not available on the records of the concerned authorities due to lapse of time.

[23] The IAD found that the Shaikh Affidavit set out the affiant’s unsuccessful attempts on behalf of the Applicant to obtain a divorce certificate from the courts and government offices. Further, it found that the marriage was “in accordance with the customs, rites and rituals prevailing in Islamic religion amongst Muslim[s]” and that the divorce by mutual consent was also completed “as per the Muslim customs prevailing in India at the relevant time”. The IAD stated that the affidavit did not elaborate on the applicable laws in India and that there was no expert opinion letter. The IAD also noted that counsel for the Applicant submitted in a letter to the visa officer (in fact, this would appear to have been the response to the procedural fairness letter from the Applicant’s the immigration consultant) that the Applicant’s first marriage was not legal in India and, therefore, he was unable to obtain a divorce. However, the IAD noted that his counsel provided no legal analysis to support that the Applicant’s first marriage was not legal in India and, therefore, that the Applicant was unable to obtain a divorce. Further, the IAD found that the submission was incorrect because Shariah law applied to both the marriage and the divorce under The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937. Therefore, no formal registration with a civil authority of the marriage or divorce was required either of them to be recognized in India.

[24] In other words, the IAD found that the Applicant had not provided sufficient evidence to support his argument at his first marriage was not legally valid in India and, for that reason, he was unable obtain a legal divorce.

[25] In that regard, it is of note that the Shaikh Affidavit does not suggest that the first marriage was not legally valid in India. In fact, the Affidavit does not identify any applicable laws of India, nor does it indicate if any such laws officially recognize religious marriages (and divorces) as valid in India without necessity of registration or other steps. Nor does the Affidavit explain why the affiant would seek a declaration of divorce from a court or government office if it was already known that the marriage and divorce had been solely religious in nature. The Affidavit also states that the affiant personally visited the “respective government offices” (which are not identified in the Affidavit) and the court, but that no documentation in respect to the divorce was available “due to a lapse of time”. This seems to contradict the vague inference that documentation was not available because the marriage and divorce were religious in nature and therefore were not documented by the state or other authority. Significantly, the Affidavit does not explain whether or not the state or other authority will provide official confirmation of religious marriages or divorces if requested to do so.

[26] In my view, based on the evidence before it, the IAD did not err in finding that the Applicant had not established that his first marriage was not legally valid in India, thereby precluding him from obtaining a legal divorce in India as had been asserted by this immigration consultant.

[27] While the IAD found that no formal registration of the marriage or divorce with a civil authority was required for them to be recognized in India, this does not support the Applicant’s argument that the IAD’s reasons are contradictory. The Applicant appears to conflate the recognition of the validity of his marriage and divorce in India with their validity in Canada when, in fact, the former does not guarantee the latter. The IAD accepted that both the first marriage and divorce were valid in India. This meant that the IAD did not accept the Applicant’s submission that his first marriage was not legally valid in India. Moreover, the IAD’s concern was with the verbal divorce. That is, while the divorce may have been valid in India, this did not address whether it was valid under Canadian law.

[28] Thus, the IAD next considered whether the Applicant’s divorce was legally valid in Canada. This is because section 117(9)(c)(i) of the IRP Regulations precludes the sponsor of a spouse from being married to another person at the time of sponsorship. Polygamous marriages are not recognized under Canadian law.

[29] The IAD relied on Amin to support the view that courts have found that it is the formal recognition of the divorce by a foreign tribunal or other state authority that is relevant when assessing whether a divorce will be recognized in Canada under section 22 of the Divorce Act. The Applicant submits that the IAD’s reading of Amin was unreasonably narrow, and that the IAD recognized unregistered marriages and divorces are recognized in India. The Applicant submits that, therefore, formal recognition from a court or government office is not necessary. Further, that he provided both the Shaikh Affidavit and the Divorce Certificate as evidence in support of his appeal.

[30] I note that in Amin, the issue was whether the IAD had erred by finding the applicant had failed to establish the existence of a legally valid divorce, which would have permitted him to sponsor his spouse from a second marriage.

[31] In Amin, this Court found a declaration given by the Pakistan High Court was deliberate in pronouncing that the applicant’s 1993 talaq divorce was effective in Shariah law and, therefore, his second marriage was valid. However, other portions of that decision noted that the applicant’s talaq divorce was not registered under the Muslim Family Law Ordinance (1961) until July 30, 2005, and became effective on that date. The Court noted that while these observations appeared somewhat incongruent, they might be reconciled by the fact that polygamous marriage is accepted under Shariah law.

[32] What was left unanswered in the evidence was whether the applicant’s failure to comply with the Muslim Family Law Ordinance (1961) rendered his 1993 talaq divorce invalid for other than religious purposes in Pakistan. The Court noted that on the face of that Ordinance, it was apparent that a talaq form of divorce was not effective until the expiration of ninety days from the day on which notice was delivered to the Chairman of the Arbitration Council. This was confirmed in the Divorce Certificate issued by the Arbitration Council to the Applicant, which clearly stated that the 1993 divorce was made effective only on July 30, 2005. That Certificate went on to state that “[t]he parties are now at liberty to marry according to Muslim family law 1961”. The Court in Amin found that the IAD’s finding that the Applicant had not proven the legal validity in Pakistan of his 1993 divorce was reasonable.

[33] The Court also noted that, for the purpose of applying domestic law, it had serious reservations about the appropriateness of recognizing extra-judicial divorces such as the talaq. The obvious intent of subsection 22(1) of the Divorce Act was to require that some form of adjudicative or official oversight be present before Canada would recognize a foreign divorce. In the matter before it, that requirement would have been fulfilled by the process dictated by the Muslin Family Law Ordinance (1961). The Court stated that the obvious purpose of such oversight is to address important public policy issues that can arise out of the domestic recognition of informal or religious-based divorces (at para 20).

[34] The Court in Amin also distinguished Schwebel v Ungar, 1964 CanLII 22 (SCC), [1965] SCR 148 [Schwebel]. The Court stated that, in that case, the Supreme Court seemed to have recognized the validity of a Jewish rabbinical divorce in Canada on the basis that the evidence in Schwebel was to the effect that such a religious divorce was formally conducted before a Rabbi and was recognized by the State of Israel. There was no indication that any Israeli statutory requirements were not met and this process seemed to have been the only available means of obtaining a divorce in Israel at the time.

[35] The Court in Amin concluded:

[26] It follows from the above that, for the purposes of section 117(9)(c) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, Mr. Amin’s first marriage was not effectively dissolved until 2005 when the requirements of the Muslin Family Law Ordinance 1961 were met. Because, under Canadian law, Mr. Amin was still married to his first wife when he married for a second time, his application to sponsor his second wife was statutorily barred. The after-acquired 2005 divorce decree does not overcome this statutory impediment: see Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Subala, (1997) 1997 CanLII 16671 (FC), 134 F.T.R. 298, 73 A.W.C.S. (3d) 315.

[36] In the matter before me, and unlike in Amin, the Applicant did not put forward any evidence from a court or other government authority to support that his divorce from his first wife was effective. Nor do I agree with the Applicant’s submission that his case is nearly factually identical to Schwebel, because the Applicant provided no evidence to the IAD to establish that his religious divorce was recognized by the state or that religious divorce was the only means of obtaining a divorce. Indeed, the Divorce Order from his second marriage would seem to suggest otherwise.

[37] In this matter, the IAD found that while the Applicant’s divorce was valid in India since registration of the divorce with civil authorities is not mandatory, the lack of judicial or other state oversight of the divorce rendered it invalid in Canada. While the Applicant submits that the IAD too narrowly interpreted Amin and section 22 of the Divorce Act, in the absence of any evidence as to the relationship between religious marriages and divorces and the laws of the state of India – that is, whether the state can officially recognize and document religious marriages or divorces or whether the state officially recognizes documentation issued by other specified entities – the IAD reasonably found that the Applicant’s divorce from his first wife would not be recognized under Canadian law as it lacks recognition by a foreign tribunal or state authority.

[38] Contrary to the Applicant’s submission, the IAD did consider the Divorce Certificate. It found that the document was issued by a religious official, not by a state or judicial authority. While the Divorce Certificate supported the Applicant’s contention that he obtained a verbal Islamic divorce by khula (or mutual consent) in 2004, this did not resolve the legality of his divorce in Canada. As indicated above, the IAD found that the Applicant’s Shariah divorce from his first wife would not be recognized in Canada because it lacks formal recognition of a divorce by a foreign tribunal or other state authority. I would add that the Divorce Certificate appears to be based on the Applicant’s submissions and explicitly refers to the statement in the Shaikh Affidavit that no documentation was available in court of government records due to the lapse of time.

[39] I also note that the 2012 Divorce Order pertaining to the Applicant’s second marriage indicates the second marriage was “solemnized as per Muslim rites and customs” and that his second wife had produced a Marriage Certificate and a copy of Nikahnama. In his evidence presented to the IAD, the Applicant does not explain the nature of his second marriage or why his second wife was able to provide this documentation and obtain a Divorce Order under the The Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939 but he was not able to provide a similar court order with respect to the divorce of his first marriage. As the IAD recognized, the onus was on the Applicant to establish that he was not married to his first wife when he married his Spouse.

[40] The 2012 Divorce Order also indicates that the Applicant suppressed his previous marriage from his second wife and that she became aware of it when she came across a notice sent by his first wife, at which point the Applicant acknowledged that he would need to obtain a divorce from his first wife. The evidence in the record also does not explain this information in relation to the Applicant’s claim to have obtained a divorce from his first wife in 2004, which would have been prior to his second marriage in 2006.

[41] Given the evidence before it, the IAD’s conclusion that the Applicant’s religious divorce in India was not valid under Canadian law was reasonable. The Applicant simply failed to provide sufficient evidence to support either that his first marriage was not valid in India, or that the circumstances of his divorce from his first wife would also support his divorce as legally valid in Canada. In the result, the IAD reasonably found that the Applicant’s marriage to his Spouse was not valid under Canadian law and the Spouse is not a member of the family class, and is therefore inadmissible under subsection 11(1) of the IRPA.

[42] The Applicant also asserts that the IAD erred by failing to consider or grant a Tabesh conversion. In Tabesh, the IAD found that if a person applies to be sponsored as a member of the family class and is refused based on the formal validity of the marriage, it is incumbent to consider whether the person could alternatively be sponsored either as a conjugal or common-law partner.

[43] As Justice Fothergill stated in Tang:

[32] The “Tabesh conversion” is a creation of the IAD. It appears to be derived from s 67(2) of the IRPA, which states that where the IAD allows an appeal it may set aside the original decision and substitute the determination that “in its opinion, should have been made”. However, opinion is divided among members of the IAD regarding its authority to make such a conversion (Rahimi v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 CarswellNat 6113 (Imm. and Ref. Bd. (App. Div.))). Even where the authority is believed to exist, the decision to permit such a conversion is wholly discretionary (Shahabi v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 CarswellNat 6397 (Imm. and Ref. Bd. (App. Div.))).

[33] Assuming, without deciding, that the IAD had a duty to consider an alternative category of relationship under s 117(1)(a) of the Regulations, the onus was on Mr. Tang to provide sufficient credible evidence in support of his request (Oladipo v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 FC 366 at para 24). The IAD was not required to invite additional submissions regarding the possible existence of a conjugal relationship once it found that the formal requirements of a marriage under Vietnamese law had not been met.

[44] As in Tang, I will assume, without deciding, that the IAD has the authority and discretion to make a Tabesh conversion. In the matter before me, I agree with the Respondent that once the IAD determined the Applicant had failed to establish that he was validly divorced from his first wife and, therefore, that he was not free to marry his Spouse under Canadian law and that his Spouse was accordingly expressly excluded as a member of the family class under section 117(9)(c)(i) of the IRPA, it was open to the IAD to refuse to exercise its discretion to convert the appeal to a conjugal sponsorship.

PRESENT:   The Honourable Mr. Justice Annis

BETWEEN:




S.S.R.




Applicant




and




THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION




Respondent

JUDGMENT AND REASONS

[1]               This is an application for judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA or the Act] challenging an Immigration Appeal Division [IAD or the Board] decision refusing the Applicant’s appeal from a visa officer’s refusal to grant the Applicant’s wife a permanent resident visa under the Spousal Sponsorship provisions of the Act. The Applicant is seeking to have the decision set aside and sent back for redetermination by a differently constituted panel.

[2]               For the reasons that follow, the application is dismissed.

I.                  Background

[3]               The Applicant, S.S.R., is a citizen of India who was himself sponsored in the past by his ex-wife. As a result, the Applicant became a permanent resident upon arrival in Canada on January 17, 1987. The couple married on April 5, 1987 and have two Canadian born children. They separated in 2005 and divorced in 2009.

[4]               The Applicant’s wife, K.K.R., is a citizen of India with two daughters aged 22 and 24. She married her first husband in 1989. He travelled to Canada in 2004 where he filed a refugee application. His parents and siblings live in Canada. K.K.R. remained married to him until he passed away in 2010. She lived with her two daughters on his family’s property in India until it is alleged that the deceased husband’s family asked them to leave following his death.

[5]               The Applicant travelled to India from February 2010 to April 2010, but did not meet his wife or any other potential spouse as he claimed to have had no intention of re-marrying.

[6]               At some point in late 2010, the Applicant claims to have contacted a friend to assist him in finding a suitable wife. As a result, the Applicant was provided with his spouse’s telephone number. He claims to have initiated their first contact via telephone in December 2010.

[7]               On January 6, 2011, the Applicant travelled to India without having seen a photo of his intended spouse. On January 18, 2011, he met her in person, along with her two adult daughters, mother, brother and sister-in-law. They decided to get married on the same day. The marriage ceremony occurred four days later on January 22, 2011. The marriage did not follow local custom, without the usual delay following the death of the husband, having some 200 persons in attendance, and at place removed from the wife’s neighbourhood and with many family and relatives not attending.

[8]               On July 13, 2011, the Applicant’s spouse’s permanent resident application was received. She was interviewed on April 5, 2012. The same day, the application was refused owing to the visa officer’s determination that the marriage was not genuine and entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring status or privilege under the Act.

[9]               The Applicant appealed the visa officer’s decision to the IAD. A de novo hearing was held, where the Applicant, his spouse and her daughter testified over two sittings on January 30, 2015 and May 2015. At the first hearing documentary evidence was provided showing that the appellant had received a pardon for nine criminal convictions, but the documentation was incomplete. The second sitting was scheduled to provide the Applicant an opportunity to provide evidence and submissions as to whether he met the requirements for sponsor pursuant to paragraph 133(1)(e) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations [the Regulations] despite his 9 criminal convictions.

[10]           On July 7, 2015, the Board dismissed the appeal. This is the decision under current judicial review.

II.               Impugned Decision

[11]           The Board set out three issues to be determined. First, whether the Applicant discharged his onus that the marriage was genuine or not, and entered into primarily for immigration purposes. Second, whether sections 133(1)(e) and 133(2) of the Regulations applied as a result of his past criminal convictions. Third, whether there were sufficient humanitarian and compassionate [H&C] factors to warrant special relief.

[12]           The Board concluded that the Applicant did not meet his onus of proving that the marriage was not entered into primarily for immigration purposes. Consequently, the second and third issues were no longer relevant.

[13]           In arriving at its conclusion that the marriage was entered into primarily for immigration purposes, the Board made adverse credibility findings based on numerous ambiguous answers and inconsistencies among the couple’s testimonies and their documentation, some of which include: the date of their initial contact; knowledge of the Applicant’s parents and their reason for not attending the wedding; the date of the Applicant’s divorce and whether he sought another potential wife prior to marrying his spouse; the Applicant and his spouse’s intention for marrying one another and their wedding ceremony which was performed in a manner contrary to their community’s social norms; the Applicant’s work history and the financial support provided to his spouse and her daughters; and the Applicant’s spouse’s two failed attempts to obtain a Temporary Resident Visa to Canada since April 2010.

III.            Legislative Framework

[14]           The following provision of the Regulations is applicable in these proceedings:

4 (1) For the purposes of these Regulations, a foreign national shall not be considered a spouse, a common-law partner or a conjugal partner of a person if the marriage, common-law partnership or conjugal partnership

	

4 (1) Pour l’application du présent règlement, l’étranger n’est pas considéré comme étant l’époux, le conjoint de fait ou le partenaire conjugal d’une personne si le mariage ou la relation des conjoints de fait ou des partenaires conjugaux, selon le cas :

 




(a) was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act; or

 

	

a) visait principalement l’acquisition d’un statut ou d’un privilège sous le régime de la Loi;

 




(b) is not genuine.

 

	

b) n’est pas authentique.

IV.            Issue

[15]           The only issue argued was whether the Board erred in law in finding that the marriage was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring status or privilege under the IRPA.

V.               Standard of Review

[16]           The parties agree that an IAD appeal of an immigration officer’s spousal sponsorship application refusal attracts a standard of reasonableness: Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9 [Dunsmuir].

VI.            Analysis

[17]           The Applicant submits that the Board erred in concluding that the wife’s intention in marrying the Applicant was unclear. He argues that the panel failed to consider relevant factors, misinterpreted and ignored the evidence before it and made illogical and unintelligible findings that are not based in the evidence and are actually contradicted by the evidentiary record.

[18]           The Court notes that the IAD found neither the Applicant nor his spouse to be credible. At the beginning of its analysis, the Board provided numerous examples of inconsistencies among the Applicant’s testimony, his spouse’s testimony and the documentation. For the most part, the Applicant did not attempt to challenge these reasons.

[19]           In addition, the Board described many other inconsistencies and changed testimony as it dealt serially with each of the issues raised before it. The Board concluded that the testimony of both parties was often confusing, and that the Applicant failed to answer questions directly. The transcript supports these conclusions, including the many instances cited in the transcript where the panel member was required to ask the witness to answer the question posed. Such overall negative credibility findings provide a reasonable foundation for the Board’s rejection of the spouses’ declarations of their motivation to marry.

[20]           The Applicant’s principal submission was that the Board erred in not finding that the intention of the parties was genuine, given some of the similarities in their situations relating to their age, marital situations and reasonable desire to start over again. This submission overlooks the many reasons provided by the IAD undermining a reasonable intention that could be ascribed to the Applicant and his spouse for marrying based upon general experience of why and how persons enter into a marriage. The first inconsistency relates to the strikingly unusual genesis of the initial contact, the immediacy of their agreeing to marry, the speed with which the marriage ceremony was carried out some four days afterwards, the breach of local customs of the marriage ceremony, including its size for a second marriage, where it was held outside of the spouse’s neighborhood and the minimal family attendance.

[21]           With respect to the mutual suitability of the Applicant and the spouse, the Board’s rejection of the genuine intention to marry is also reasonable given the lack of time to develop and consider the nature of their relationship, when reasonable judgment before entering into serious long-term relationship would raise serious concerns about the chances of a successful marriage.

[22]           The Applicant had a serious criminal record that included violent domestic abuse, assault with a weapon, restraining orders and a failed marriage with him remaining estranged from his ex-spouse and children. As the wife similarly claimed to be the victim of a failed marriage caused by her husband’s abandonment, it would seem reasonable that before making a life-long commitment for her and her family, that the Applicant would not immediately be considered a suitable candidate.

[23]           The Court also finds reasonable the Board’s rejection of the genuineness of the spouse’s motivation to marry the Applicant as a means to attain financial settlement and stability for her and her daughters. The evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the Applicant was not in a position to financially settle the family in Canada. He provided no probative evidence to corroborate his claims to have a suitable financial situation from his employment as a truck driver, such as income tax assessments or letters from employers in the 2010-2011 period.

[24]           Moreover, in a letter to the Parole Board in 2013, whereby the Applicant re-applied for a pardon for his extensive criminal convictions, his acknowledgement is noted that in September 2010, just four months prior to the marriage, he was on social assistance and unemployed. It was only at that time that he indicated that the pardon would help him obtain work as a truck driver. This employment was advanced as the basis for his financial situation that the spouse was apparently relying on to provide financial stability.

[25]           The Court similarly does not find unreasonable the IAD’s conclusion that an important motivating factor in support of the marriage was the desire of the deceased husband’s parents (and four siblings) to have the two granddaughters and their mother come live with or near them in Canada.

[26]           Part of this reasoning relates to the Board’s skepticism that the spouse’s relationship with her deceased husband was on bad terms. He left the family in 2004 to travel to Canada where he initiated a refugee claim which apparently remained outstanding until his death in 2010. The spouse first testified that the deceased husband had not provided for her and her children after he moved to Canada. However, she was caught up in another inconsistency and ultimately acknowledged that he sent the family money, but claiming it was not enough. The amounts provided by the deceased husband were not corroborated, it is assumed because they were not initially admitted. The spouse also was described as weeping while she gave evidence about her deceased husband. In these circumstances, the Board’s skepticism is reasonable when there is no objective evidence to suggest that the deceased husband was not continuing to provide for the family and that his intention would be to reunite the family in Canada were he to obtain permanent residency.

[27]           The Applicant had also argued that her husband’s parents had treated her and her two daughters badly by turning them out of the deceased husband’s family home in India. Apart from her unreliable testimony, there is no evidence to contradict the strong presumption that grandparents would have normally been imbued with strong feelings of love and affection for their grandchildren or nieces, and this regardless of how things stood between the parents. Given the death of their son, and accepting that the intention of the marriage was to provide stable financial living conditions for the family, it is not unreasonable that the deceased husband’s family members would very much want his daughters to live with or near them in Canada, for all the reasons that he had made a refugee claim. This is all the more so when the Applicant and the spouse can offer no apparent reasonable basis for their hasty marriage or means of alleged financial support.

[28]           In light of the above, I find the Board’s conclusion reasonable that the Applicant and his spouse were not credible in their statements describing their motivation to marry and that they did not establish as a likelihood that it was not entered into for immigration purposes contrary to section 4 of the Regulations.

VII.         Conclusion

[29]           The application is dismissed. No question is certified for appeal.




JUDGMENT

THIS COURT’S JUDGMENT is that the application is dismissed and no question is certified for appeal.

Montreal, Quebec, December 11, 2018

PRESENT:  The Honourable Madam Justice Roussel

BETWEEN:




ASAAD AL MOUSAWMAII




Applicant




and




THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION




Respondent

JUDGMENT AND REASONS

I.  Introduction

[1]  The applicant, Asaad Al Mousawmaii, is seeking judicial review of a decision rendered on January 18, 2018, by an immigration officer, rejecting his application for permanent residence presented under the spouse or common-law partner in Canada class.

[2]  For the reasons that follow, the application for judicial review is allowed.

II.  Factual Background

[3]  The applicant is a citizen of Lebanon. He entered Canada on April 29, 2011, and filed a refugee protection claim. That claim was withdrawn at a later date for reasons that are not included in the record of the proceedings.

[4]  In May 2012, the applicant met his spouse, a Canadian citizen of Moroccan origin. After dating for several months, they moved in together and got married on June 26, 2013.

[5]  On October 24, 2013, the applicant filed an initial application for permanent residence in the spouse or common-law partner in Canada class. His application was accompanied by a sponsorship application submitted by his spouse.

[6]  After the birth of their first child on April 27, 2014, the applicant and his spouse separated. During this separation, the applicant had a brief relationship with another woman. The applicant and his spouse resumed cohabitation in the summer of 2015.

[7]  On September 24, 2015, the applicant’s spouse withdrew her sponsorship undertaking. One month later, she submitted a request seeking to reverse the withdrawal of her sponsorship undertaking, but her request was denied by an immigration officer.

[8]  On April 11, 2016, the applicant’s spouse gave birth to the couple’s second child.

[9]  On August 29, 2016, the applicant filed a second application for permanent residence under the spouse or common-law partner in Canada class. During processing of the application, a tip was sent to the respondent at the following email address: Citizenship-fraud-tips@cic.gc.ca. The applicant’s file was then transferred to an immigration officer by the Case Processing Centre in Mississauga.

[10]  After interviewing the couple on November 1, 2017, the immigration officer rejected the application on January 18, 2018. In her letter to the applicant, she stated that she was not convinced that he had a genuine relationship with the sponsor.

[11]  The applicant is seeking judicial review of this decision. He argues that the decision is unreasonable and that it was rendered in violation of the rules of procedural fairness. He is asking this Court to set aside the immigration officer’s decision and to refer the matter back to a different immigration officer for redetermination.

III.  Analysis
A.  Standard of review

[12]  It is well-established that the standard of review applicable to a finding that a marriage is not genuine or that it was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring a status or privilege under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 [IRPA], is that of reasonableness, since it raises questions of fact and law (Onwubolu v Canada (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship), 2018 FC 19 at para 11 [Onwubolu]; Shahzad v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 999 at para 14).

[13]  When the reasonableness standard applies, the role of the Court is to determine whether the decision falls within the range of “possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law”. When “justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process” exist, it is not open to the Court to substitute its own preferred outcome (Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9 at para. 47 [Dunsmuir]).

[14]  With respect to the allegation of a lack of procedural fairness, the Federal Court of Appeal recently clarified that questions of procedural fairness do not necessarily lend themselves to a standard of review analysis. Instead, the role of this Court is to determine whether the procedure was fair having regard to all of the circumstances (Canadian Pacific Railway Company v Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 69 at para 54; Dunsmuir at para 79).

B.  Preliminary questions
(1)  Applicant’s affidavit

[15]  In both the memorandum filed and at the hearing, the respondent’s preliminary remarks raised the argument that the applicant’s affidavit, signed on April 24, 2018, did not comply with paragraph 80(2.1) of the Federal Court Rules, SOR/98-106 [Rules], because it was written in French and did not include an interpreter’s declaration.

[16]  The Court also notes that the supplementary affidavit signed on August 23, 2018, does not include an interpreter’s declaration. However, unlike the affidavit from April, the supplementary affidavit contains a paragraph indicating that the affidavit [translation] “was drafted, prepared and read in French” and that the applicant [translation] “declares that he understands its exact contents”.

[17]  Counsel for the applicant replied that he took all the necessary precautions to ensure that the affiant understood the exact contents of his affidavit. The affidavit was reportedly read to the applicant in the presence of his spouse who translated it for him as it was being read.

[18]  The translation of the statements contained in the affidavit by the applicant’s spouse does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph 80(2.1) of the Rules. Since the applicant’s affidavit fails to comply with the Rules, it was given little weight (Singh v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 315 at para 44).

(2)  Style of cause

[19]  The original style of cause included the applicant’s spouse as a co-applicant. Further to a conference call held at the request of the Court after the hearing, counsel for each of the parties confirmed that the request for judicial review concerned only the applicant and his application for permanent residence filed in the spouse or common-law partner in Canada class. The name of the applicant’s spouse was therefore removed from the style of cause.

C.  Reasonableness of the decision

[20]  The Court is of the opinion that the immigration officer’s decision does not meet the intelligibility test prescribed by Dunsmuir.

[21]  Under paragraph 12(1) of the IRPA, in order to be selected as a permanent resident in the family class, the applicant must meet the definition of spouse, common-law partner or other family member, as provided in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227 [IRPR].

[22]  Moreover, in order to be a part of the spouse or common-law partner in Canada class, the conditions set out in section 124 of the IRPR must be met. This provision reads as follows:

Member

	

Qualité




124 A foreign national is a member of the spouse or common-law partner in Canada class if they

	

124 Fait partie de la catégorie des époux ou conjoints de fait au Canada l’étranger qui remplit les conditions suivantes :




(a) are the spouse or common-law partner of a sponsor and cohabit with that sponsor in Canada;

	

a) il est l’époux ou le conjoint de fait d’un répondant et vit avec ce répondant au Canada;




(b) have temporary resident status in Canada; and

	

b) il détient le statut de résident temporaire au Canada;




(c) are the subject of a sponsorship application.

	

c) une demande de parrainage a été déposée à son égard.

[23]  This provision must be read in conjunction with section 4 of the IRPR, which states as follows:

Bad faith

	

Mauvaise foi




4(1) For the purposes of these Regulations, a foreign national shall not be considered a spouse, a common-law partner or a conjugal partner of a person if the marriage, common-law partnership or conjugal partnership

	

4(1) Pour l’’application du présent règlement, l’’étranger n’’est pas considéré comme étant l’’époux, le conjoint de fait ou le partenaire conjugal d’’une personne si le mariage ou la relation des conjoints de fait ou des partenaires conjugaux, selon le cas :




(a) was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act; or

	

a) visait principalement l’’acquisition d’’un statut ou d’’un privilège sous le régime de la Loi;




(b) is not genuine.

	

b) n’est pas authentique.

[24]  The wording of section 4 of the IRPR is unambiguous. A finding of bad faith may be based either on a finding that the marriage was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring a status or privilege under the IRPA or on a finding that the marriage is not genuine.

[25]  In addition to being disjunctive, these tests also include a temporal distinction. Paragraph 4(1)(a) requires an assessment of the spouses’ intention at the time of the marriage while paragraph 4(1)(b) calls for an assessment of the authenticity of the marriage at the present time (Onwubolu, at paras 13–14; Gill v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1522 at paras 30, 33; Singh v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 1077 at paras 6, 26).

[26]  In her letter to the applicant, the immigration officer concluded that he did not meet the criteria for the spouse or common-law partner in Canada class because she was not convinced that he had a genuine relationship with his sponsor. However, in her case notes, which are taken to be the reasons for the decision (Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1999 CanLII 699 (SCC), [1999] 2 SCR 817 at para 44), she observes that the applicant must show that [translation] “the marriage was not entered into with the goal of obtaining permanent residence in Canada”. She continues by conducting an analysis similar to an assessment of the authenticity of the relationship. Finally, she concludes that the applicant is maintaining a relationship with the primary goal of acquiring a status in Canada.

[27]  Even though the immigration officer appears to rely on the test provided in paragraph 4(1)(b) of the IRPR in her letter to the applicant, despite using the term “relationship” instead of “marriage”, both the observation she makes in her notes concerning the applicant’s burden and the language used in her conclusion suggest rather the application of the test set out in paragraph 4(1)(a) of the IRPR. Given this ambiguity, the decision lacks intelligibility. The immigration officer should have clarified whether the applicant had failed to satisfy one or both of the criteria and provided the reasons for her decision accordingly.

[28]  Moreover, given the inconsistency between the immigration officer’s observation, her analysis and the conclusion in her case notes, it is impossible to determine whether the immigration officer applied the appropriate legal tests to reach her decision. Even with a generous application of the principles of Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses’ Union v Newfoundland and Labrador (Treasury Board), 2011 SCC 62, and deference towards the decision, the Court is not satisfied that the immigration officer did not confuse the tests set out in section 4 of the IRPR. Even though there could be links between the primary purpose of the marriage and its authenticity, these are distinct tests under section 4 of the IRPR, which require an assessment based on different temporal dimensions. The use of the present tense to indicate that the applicant [translation] “is maintaining a relationship with the primary goal of acquiring a status in Canada” suggests that the agent confused the two distinct legal tests.

[29]  For these reasons, the immigration officer’s decision is unreasonable because it does not satisfy the intelligibility test prescribed by Dunsmuir. The application for judicial review must therefore be allowed and the matter shall be referred back to a different officer for redetermination.

D.  Redacting the certified tribunal record

[30]  The Court finds it necessary to address one last point. Of its own accord, the respondent redacted certain pages of the certified tribunal record [CTR], namely, the tip-off email sent to the respondent to cast doubt on the authenticity of the marriage between the applicant and his spouse. The immigration officer who signed the certification that accompanied the tribunal record justified the fact that the document had been redacted by stating that disclosing the information would be injurious to national security or endanger the safety of any person. In a letter sent to the Court three days later, the respondent also cited informer privilege as an additional reason.

[31]  At the hearing, the Court raised the redaction with the respondent. Since the Court was not satisfied with the response received, it invited counsel for both parties, by means of directions after the hearing, to provide written submissions on the application of section 87 of the IRPA to this matter and should it not apply, on the requirement to obtain leave from the Court before submitting a file containing redacted excerpts.

[32]  In the context of a judicial review, sections 87 and 83 of the IRPA allow the minister to request the non-disclosure of information and other evidence when disclosure could be injurious to national security or endanger the safety of any person. In general, such a request is supported by a secret affidavit explaining the reasons why the redacted information cannot be disclosed and includes an appended document with the information the minister is seeking to protect. The judge assigned to the case would then review the minister’s request and, where necessary, hold an in-camera ex parte hearing at which the minister may call upon the author of the secret affidavit to testify and explain his reasons for seeking to keep the information confidential. If the appointed judge concludes that the disclosure of the redacted information would be injurious to national security or endanger the safety of any person, this information will remain secret and will not be accessible to the applicant, counsel for the applicant or the public. However, the designated judge could order that a summary of the redacted information be provided to the applicant in order to allow the applicant to be sufficiently informed. The summary may not contain any element that if disclosed, would be injurious to national security or endanger the safety of any person (Soltanizadeh v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 114; Karakachian v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2009 FC 948).

[33]  In submissions filed on October 19, 2018, the respondent does [translation] “not deny the possible application of section 87 of the IRPA” and indicates that [translation] “at first sight, this is effectively a case where (within the meaning of section 83 of the IRPA to which section 87 refers), the disclosure of information or other evidence could potentially be injurious to national security or endanger the safety of any person”. However, the respondent concluded that the common law police informer or informant privilege was more appropriate than the process set out in section 87 to protect the information referred to in this matter. The respondent argued that because of the absolute nature of the privilege, which takes precedence over any procedural fairness that could be affected, there had been no need to obtain prior authorization from the Court to legitimately redact any information protected by that privilege from the tribunal record. Relying on the principles set out by this Court in Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Hanjra, 2018 FC 208 [Hanjra 208], the respondent added that there is no doubt that this privilege is applicable to immigration matters and to the tip-off system established in partnership with the Canada Border Services Agency. The respondent invited the Court to make a distinction from its earlier case law under which fairness required that the applicant be presented with the entire tip-off in order to provide the applicant with a fair opportunity to react to it (see Patel v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1389 at para 32). Finally, the respondent asked the Court to certify a question for the purposes of appeal in the event that the Court determined that the immigration officer’s decision was unreasonable, either because the applicant was not informed of the existence of the tip-off or because he was not given a full or redacted copy thereof.

[34]  Considering its finding that the decision was unreasonable, the Court does not intend to express an opinion on whether or not the privilege raised by the respondent applies in this matter. However, the Court believes that it must distinguish this case from Hanjra 208, cited by the respondent. In that case, the Court was asked to consider an application for judicial review of a decision of the Immigration Appeal Division [IAD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, which ordered the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration [minister] to provide an unredacted appeal file, including the part of the file which, according to the minister, was subject to police informer privilege. Mr. Justice Richard F. Southcott concluded that the IAD had erred in finding that it was entitled to have access to information subject to police informer privilege and that it had an obligation to review the redacted information to confirm the privilege. The decision on which the respondent relies in this matter does not concern this Court’s power to review information for which privilege is claimed. On the contrary, the decision recognizes that in cases where the administrative tribunal does not have such authority, the matter would have to be referred to this Court (Hanjra 208 at para 51).

[35]  Even though the respondent does not refer to it, the Court notes that Southcott J. was simultaneously considering another application filed by the minister that stemmed from the same sponsorship file. The minister had provided the IAD with a certificate opposing the disclosure of the redacted information under section 37 of the Canada Evidence Act, RSC 1985, c C-5 [CEA]. The minister sought to have the Federal Court render a decision on this opposition, which led Southcott J. to make a determination on the application of police informer privilege (see Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Hanjra, 2018 FC 207 [Hanjra 207]. It is important to note that in the context of that application, unlike the matter we are concerned with here, counsel for the minister brought a copy of a confidential affidavit to the hearing; the unredacted notes from the GCMS were appended to this confidential affidavit, including the part concerned by the privilege. Counsel for the minister advised that he was prepared to file a copy of the confidential affidavit if the Court issued an order preserving its confidentiality. The Court received the confidential affidavit, which was filed under an order of confidentiality. Even though Southcott J. concluded that privilege applied to the redacted parts of the notes and accepted the principle that courts will decline to review privileged documents to ensure a claim of privilege, he nevertheless recognized that the evidence or the arguments presented in the context of another case could establish the necessity of reviewing redacted passages (Hanjra 207 at para 29).

[36]  In the matter before me, the tribunal record reveals that an immigration officer had deemed that the marriage was genuine before the applicant’s spouse withdrew her sponsorship undertaking in 2015. The respondent received the two-page tip-off on January 2, 2017, in the context of the second application for permanent residence. It was found to be sufficiently credible to trigger further investigation. In an interview, the applicant was not informed of the existence of the tip-off even though the immigration officer asked him questions about certain elements of this email. It was only when he received the immigration officer’s notes, after filing his application for leave and judicial review, that the applicant learned of the existence of the tip-off. When he realized that the tip-off had been completely redacted when he received the CTR, the applicant raised a violation of procedural fairness in his supplementary memorandum.

[37]  The Court recognizes that it is important not only to protect the identity of an informant who has been promised confidentiality, but also to protect the information that could identify the informant. However, the Court must be able to perform its duties. Whether it is an application filed under section 87 of the IRPA for cases where disclosure would be injurious to national security or endanger the safety of any person, an application under section 37 of the CEA when the objection is made on the grounds of public interest, or a motion for order of confidentiality under section 151 of the Rules, it is difficult to imagine that one party, alone, would be able to determine whether or not certain information should be disclosed to the other party when this information was before the administrative decision-maker and might have influenced the administrative decision-maker’s decision.

[38]  That being said, the Court does not intend to discuss this issue any further. Consequently, the Court does not intend to certify the question proposed by the respondent.

The application for judicial review is allowed;

[ENGLISH TRANSLATION]

Ottawa, Ontario, June 7, 2016

PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Harrington

BETWEEN:




NADIA BOUHIA




Applicant




and




THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION




Respondent

JUDGMENT AND REASONS

[1]               This is an application for judicial review against a citizenship judge’s decision to deny the application for Canadian citizenship made by the applicant, Ms. Bouhia. The application was made before the Citizenship Act was changed in 2014. In the judge’s opinion, the applicant had not discharged her burden to show that she had been in Canada for at least three of the four years (1,095 days) preceding her application. The judge, in exercising his discretionary power, chose the strict criterion of physical presence, as established by Mr. Justice Muldoon in Re Pourghasemi, [1993] F.C.J. No. 232, 62 F.T.R. 122. That should not have been a problem because the applicant claimed to have been in Canada for 1,126 days.

[2]               The judicial review hearing was scheduled for May 25, 2016. On May 6, the Minister submitted a written motion, proposing that the parties agree to a judgment allowing the application for judicial review and sending the matter back to another citizenship judge for reconsideration.

[3]               Ms. Bouhia refused to agree to the proposed terms. She considered that she was entitled to costs under Column V of Tariff B, given the shocking nature of the decision currently under review and the delay in rendering the decision. She also insisted that a hearing be held before another citizenship judge within 30 days of this Court’s judgment and that this new judge be required to find that the evidence showing that the applicant’s children had been present in Canada was proof that she had been present in Canada and that the bank statements submitted by the applicant were valid.

[4]               The Minister vigorously opposed the applicant’s proposals. Rule 22 of the Federal Courts Citizenship, Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules states that

22 No costs shall be awarded to or payable by any party in respect of an application for leave, an application for judicial review or an appeal under these Rules unless the Court, for special reasons, so orders.

	

22 Sauf ordonnance contraire rendue par un juge pour des raisons spéciales, la demande d’autorisation, la demande de contrôle judiciaire ou l’appel introduit en application des présentes règles ne donnent pas lieu à des dépens.

[5]               Under the circumstances, I issued a directive to the effect that [TRANSLATION] "The Court [was] not prepared to render a written decision regarding the judicial review" and ordered that the hearing be held on May 25, 2016, as planned.

[6]               The hearing did, in fact, take place. I advised the applicant that, before I could examine her claims regarding the findings of fact and costs, I first needed to decide on the merit of the underlying application for judicial review. I therefore could not limit myself to deciding only the question of the findings of fact and costs, even if the Minister seemed prepared to concede that the citizenship judge’s decision was unreasonable.

[7]               In this case, the applicant convinced me that the decision should be set aside. The citizenship judge’s assessment of the bank statements constituted a breach of procedural fairness.

[8]               I advised the parties that I was going to issue a judgment in accordance with that proposed by the Minister and that I would not grant the applicant’s motions regarding the findings of fact or costs. There was no particular reason to award her costs, Moreover, the findings of fact are the responsibility of the citizenship judge during reconsideration of the file, and not of the Federal Court during the judicial review.

[9]               Obviously, under the circumstances, the Minister claimed costs for the incidental expenses he incurred. He pointed out that, in the end, the applicant obtained no more than she would have obtained had she accepted the Minister’s proposal two weeks earlier, which would have avoided the hearing.

[10]           Although I was tempted to award costs to the Minister, I thought it best to end this sad story quickly. I am not awarding costs to either party.




JUDGMENT

FOR THESE REASONS

THIS COURT’S JUDGMENT is that:

1.         The application for judicial review is allowed.

2.         The citizenship judge’s decision rendered on September 23, 2015 is dismissed and the matter is sent back to another citizenship judge for reconsideration of the applicant’s citizenship application.

3.         No serious questions of general importance were certified.

4.         Without costs.

BETWEEN:




MAHMOUD Y A SHAHEEN




Applicant




And




THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION




Respondent

JUDGMENT AND REASONS

I.  Overview

[1]  On September 15, 2016, the Applicant received a removal order from the Canadian Border Services Agency [CBSA] because he failed to meet the residency requirements of his permanent resident [PR] status. He appealed that decision to the Immigration Appeal Division [IAD], which affirmed the removal order, finding insufficient humanitarian and compassionate [H&C] grounds to warrant overturning the order. The IAD decision dated January 4, 2019 [the Decision] is the subject of this application for judicial review.

[2]  As explained in more detail below, this application is dismissed, because I find the IAD reasonably considered the evidence that was before it, and it reasonably applied to that evidence the law applicable to the assessment it was required to perform.

II.  Background

[3]  The Applicant and his family landed in Canada in March 2010, arriving from Ramallah in the West Bank, Palestine, based on the Applicant’s qualification under the skilled worker category. He is a medical doctor from Palestine. His spouse is also a PR, and two of his three adult children are now Canadian citizens. His youngest son was in the process of obtaining Canadian citizenship at the time of the Decision.

[4]  Ten days after arriving in Canada, the family returned to Ramallah so that the Applicant’s daughter, his eldest child, could finish her high school exams. After she began studying at the University of Toronto, the Applicant returned to Ramallah for another year, so his elder son could finish high school without disruption. Once that son was settled at Ryerson University, the Applicant decided to enroll his younger son in an English program in Ramallah, before enrolling him in Canadian high school, to avoid certain difficulties his brother and sister were experiencing at their Canadian universities. The Applicant spent substantial time in Palestine throughout these periods that his children were studying there.

[5]  The Applicant applied to renew his PR card in March 2015 and became the subject of a PR determination investigation. On April 15, 2016, the CBSA issued a report under s 44(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA], finding the Applicant had not met his requirement under s 28 of IRPA, related to the number of days required to be resident in Canada during the five-year period following his landing. The Applicant admits he was aware of this residency requirement. However, he claims, until the CBSA called him for an interview in late 2016, he did not understand the seriousness of his non-compliance.

[6]  In November 2016, the Applicant resigned from his job with the Palestinian government and tried to sell the family’s apartment in Ramallah. The sale was unsuccessful, because construction on a neighbouring property caused damage to the Applicant’s building. With seven other owners, the Applicant began a lawsuit against the neighbour. He claims he was the most invested in this lawsuit, because he wanted to sell the apartment; and he had the most evidence and assistance to provide their counsel, as his unit is on the ground floor. The lawsuit succeeded, but three of the other claimants appealed the quantum of damages. At that point, the Applicant concluded that his presence was not required, and he came to Canada in February 2018.

[7]  Once he arrived in Canada, the Applicant took steps to find employment and enrolled in the Ryerson “Internationally Trained Medical Doctors Bridging Program” [Ryerson Bridging Program]. He completed the ﬁrst theoretical portion of the program, and was about to begin the second practical part, but found full-time employment as a consultant with a medical clinic. The Applicant testified before the IAD that he plans to buy the clinic eventually.

[8]  The Applicant’s evidence is that he remained in Palestine primarily to earn money to support his family in Canada. He worked with the Palestinian government for many years, either directly or on contracts with other organizations. He claims he has looked for work in Canada since 2010, but he was either over-qualified for the positions or lacked required Canadian experience.

[9]  At the time of the IAD hearing, the Applicant’s three children were either in university and working part-time or were working full-time in Canada. The children testified that separation from their father would be difficult on the family. They asserted that travel restrictions, which are frequently placed on the West Bank and Gaza by Israel, would prevent the Applicant from visiting them in the Canada and vice versa. Because the Applicant has resigned from his government position, he no longer holds a diplomatic passport, which he asserted will make travel to Canada more difficult for him than in the past.

III.  Decision Under Review

[10]  In reviewing the removal order, the IAD considered whether (1) the Applicant had met his PR requirements under s 28 of IRPA; and (2) sufficient H&C grounds existed to allow him to stay in Canada under s 67(1)(c) of IRPA.

[11]  The IAD affirmed the CBSA immigration officer correctly found the Applicant had not satisfied s 28, calculating the Applicant was in Canada for a total of 141 days or 19% of his minimum residency obligation during the relevant period from May 2010 to May 2015.

[12]  The IAD then considered the non-exhaustive list of factors from Bufete-Arce v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), [2003] IADD No 370 (Imm App Bd) [Bufete-Arce] and Kok v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), [2003] IADD No 514 (Imm App Bd) [Kok], which guided its determination whether to allow the appeal on H&C grounds:

the extent of the non-compliance with the residency obligation,

the Applicant’s initial and continuing degree of establishment in Canada,

reasons for departure from Canada,

reasons for continued or lengthy stay abroad,

family ties to Canada,

whether reasonable attempts to return to Canada were made at the ﬁrst opportunity,

hardship and dislocation to family members in Canada if the Applicant is removed from or is refused admission to Canada,

hardship to the applicant if removed from or refused admission to Canada, and

whether or not there are unique or special circumstances present that merit special relief.

[13]  On the first factor, the IAD rejected the Minister’s submission that residency requirements are “minimal,” but it agreed the Applicant’s non-compliance was extensive, such that significant H&C considerations would be required to allow the appeal.

[14]  Related to the Applicant’s initial degree of establishment in Canada, the IAD canvassed how the Applicant had returned to Palestine for his daughter’s exams, his elder son’s last year of high school, and his younger son’s enrollment in English school in Ramallah. It also noted his wife travelled back and forth between Canada and Palestine to stay with the children, while the Applicant only visited Canada to establish them in their respective Canadian schools. The Applicant also retained his employment in Palestine during the relevant period. The IAD found this to be a negative factor.

[15]  Related to current establishment, the IAD acknowledged some efforts by the Applicant to establish himself in Canada. He attended the Ryerson Bridging Program and was working full time as a Consulting Manager at a physiotherapy clinic, which he plans to buy. He has also held a joint bank account with his spouse since 2014 and deposited limited funds there. The family has rented an apartment together in Canada since 2015, and he has held a Canadian credit card since 2016. He also has strong English-language skills. While these were positive factors towards establishment in Canada, the IAD found they were not enough to outweigh what it considered to be lacking in terms of establishment. For example, considering the previous eight years, the IAD found the Applicant had little assets or investment in Canada, had little to no community involvement or continuing education, worked approximately 27 days in Canada, and had never filed a Canadian tax return. The IAD found the degree of current establishment limited and that this was a negative factor.

[16]  The IAD found the Applicant’s reasons for departure and lengthy stay abroad were by choice, weighing against his appeal. It acknowledged his explanation that he could not find work in Canada because he was over-qualified or did not have Canadian experience. However, it concluded that he chose to stay in his well-paying government job. It found he had not actively searched for work in Canada, as there was little documentary evidence to support his assertion of search efforts. The IAD also noted that, once the Applicant committed to being in Canada, and made concerted efforts to find employment, he enrolled in the Ryerson Bridging Program and obtained full-time employment within 6 months.

[17]  On efforts to return to Canada at the first opportunity, the IAD weighed against the Applicant the fact that he did not quit his job or try to sell his home until November 2016. He testified he did not start wrapping up his affairs in Palestine until his children were stabilized in Canada and self-sufficient, and he claimed he did not realize the seriousness of his breach until he received the removal order in 2016. The IAD rejected these explanations, finding that the Applicant realized his home was his biggest asset and he would need funds from its sale to invest in Canada, but he did not make serious efforts to try to sell it until at least 6 years after he became a PR.

[18]  The IAD also weighed against the Applicant that he stayed in Palestine for an additional period to participate in the lawsuit against his neighbour. It found insufficient evidence why he could not instruct counsel from Canada, or why the seven other owners could not handle the suit without him. It specifically noted the Applicant’s testimony that he realized in December 2017, when they won the suit and his co-owners appealed, that his “presence has no meaning” and that he could return to Canada.

[19]  The IAD acknowledged the Applicant’s family ties to Canada, but it found the hardship and dislocation to those family members would be minimal. It noted the children wanted to remain with their father in Canada and their testimony that separation over the past eight years had been difficult. However, the IAD found they would suffer minimal hardship should the Applicant be denied his PR status, because they had lived apart from him for many years, and they are financially self-sufficient adults who are working and/or in university. The IAD found the family’s phone and text relationship would continue.

[20]  Although the Applicant no longer has a diplomatic passport, which increases the difficulty of him travelling to Canada, the IAD found a lack of evidence that his children would have particular difficulty visiting him in Palestine on Canadian passports. While the Applicant having less ease of travel was a positive factor weighing in favour of the appeal, it was somewhat offset by the ability of his children to visit him.

[21]  The IAD had little evidence regarding the Applicant’s relationship with his spouse. However, it found that she had travelled back and forth between Canada and Palestine, living for signiﬁcant periods of time apart from the Applicant, such that she did not represent a strong family tie to Canada.

[22]  The IAD also found the Applicant would experience minimal hardship returning to Palestine. It noted he had only been away for less than a year; he was born, educated, and successfully earned a professional livelihood there; he still owns his own apartment in Ramallah; and, he has significant family ties to Palestine. The IAD acknowledged that Palestine faces social and political instability but emphasized that the Applicant had chosen to stay in that environment for over eight years after gaining his PR status in Canada. It therefore gave the political conditions in Palestine little weight.

[23]  Based on this analysis, the IAD affirmed the Officer’s decision, finding that the Applicant had not met his burden to persuade the IAD that the matter was worthy of H&C relief.

IV.  Issues and Standard Of Review

[24]  The Applicant articulates the following issues for the Court’s consideration:

Should the test for using equitable relief for matters arising from breach of s 28 of IRPA be different than for other appeals? In particular, should it be more guided by Chirwa and Kanthasamy than Ribic?

Did the IAD conduct an assessment as contemplated by Chirwa and conﬁrmed by Kanthasamy?

Were the IAD’s ﬁndings vis a vis the Ribic test reasonable and made without misconstruing the evidence before it?

[25]  The Applicant does not identify a standard of review. The Respondent submits that the standard is reasonableness for all issues. I concur, as there is no basis to depart from the Court’s jurisprudence reviewing decisions of the IAD on the reasonableness standard (see, e.g., Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v Antoun, 2018 FC 540 [Antoun] at para 15).

V.  Analysis
A.  Should the test for using equitable relief for matters arising from breach of s 28 of IRPA be different than for other appeals? In particular, should it be more guided by Chirwa and Kanthasamy than Ribic?

[26]  The Applicant takes the position that, when an appeal to the IAD arises from a breach of the residency requirements, as opposed to a misrepresentation or criminality, the test for H&C relief should be easier to meet. He argues that failure to meet residency requirements is less serious than a misrepresentation or criminality and that applicants like himself should therefore be able to succeed on appeal with less compelling H&C factors.

[27]  In advancing this position, the Applicant first relies on the fact that s 28 of IRPA, which creates the residency obligation, itself permits a visa officer to determine that H&C considerations overcome a breach. The Applicant notes there is no similar provision allowing for H&C relief in the context of misrepresentations or criminality prior to the appeal to the IAD. I find little merit to this submission. The IAD must take H&C factors into account in all categories of appeals. In my view, the fact that the decision-maker below in the present context may also examine those factors does not suggest a different approach to the H&C analysis to be undertaken by the IAD in an appeal therefrom.

[28]  The Applicant also submits his position is supported by the guidance in Chirwa v Canada (Manpower and Immigration) (1970), 4 IAC 338 (Imm App Bd) [Chirwa] at 350, and Kanthasamy v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 SCC 61 [Kanthasamy] at paragraph 13, to the effect that H&C considerations refer to circumstances that would excite in a reasonable person in a civilized community a desire to relieve the misfortunes of others. The Applicant argues the IAD should have analysed his circumstances in that manner, placing less reliance on the factors set out in Bufete-Arce and Kok (often referred to as the Ribic factors, based on Ribic v Canada (Employment and Immigration), [1985] IABD No 4 (Imm App Bd)). He submits such an analysis would have allowed him to overcome the breach of his residency obligation with a lower threshold of H&C considerations than the IAD required in its Decision.

[29]  Again, I do not find the Applicant’s argument compelling. As the Respondent notes, while the Ribic factors are a non-exhaustive list, the Court has recently confirmed the application of these factors to the consideration by the IAD of H&C grounds in residency obligation appeals (see, e.g. Sanchez Zapata v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 1250 at para 4; Antoun at para 20). I also agree with the Respondent that the relevant factors and the weight to be afforded to them varies depending on the specifics of each case.

[30]  These principles do not support a conclusion that the IAD is required to apply a different test in appeals arising from breaches of s 28 of IRPA. Rather, the guidance to be derived from Ribic, Chirwa, and Kanthasamy applies to H&C analyses generally, with the particular analysis to be driven by the individual facts of each case rather than by the nature of the appeal giving rise to recourse to the IAD.

[31]  The Applicant also argues the IAD should have considered the Applicant’s future intent to meet his residency obligation. He equates this consideration to the “possibility of rehabilitation” factor that Ribic prescribes for appeals arising from criminality. I agree with the Respondent’s position that the Applicant’s submissions to the IAD did not advance this argument in this manner. Moreover, applicable jurisprudence provides that the potential for establishment is not a relevant consideration, as the determination of establishment is not a forward-looking exercise (see Nassif v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 873 at para 33; Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Hassan, 2017 FC 413 at paras 24-25; Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v Hassan, 2019 FC 1090 at paras 15-16).

[32]  Finally, the Applicant relies on the recent decision in Damian v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 1158 [Damian] at para 21, in which Justice McHaffie noted that the words “exceptional” and “extraordinary” should not be considered a legal standard applicable to decisions whether to grant H&C relief. However, I do not understand the Applicant to be arguing that the IAD employed this language in an inappropriate manner in its Decision. Rather, the Applicant’s argument is a response to the Respondent’s submission that H&C relief represents an exceptional and extraordinary remedy. In that respect, the circumstances are similar to those considered in Damian (see para 18), and the applicability of that language is not determinative of this matter. To the extent the Applicant argues that the level of H&C considerations the IAD required him to demonstrate represents the application of too high a threshold, i.e. at an exceptional or extraordinary level, I do not find that to be an apt characterization of the IAD’s analysis.

B.  Did the IAD conduct an assessment as contemplated by Chirwa and conﬁrmed by Kanthasamy?

[33]  The Applicant’s argument on this issue is best summarized by his submission that the IAD’s analysis “…misses the forest by concentrating on the trees.” While the IAD focused on the fact that the Applicant maintained a home and job in Palestine, he submits it missed the central points that (1) he could not find work in Canada, and (2) he maintained his connection with Palestine only to support his family and their collective commitment to Canada. He argues the IAD improperly considered the Ribic factors individually, as there is no indication in the Decision that the IAD conducted the required global, cumulative, and holistic assessment of the factors.

[34]  The Respondent has referred the Court to the analysis in Kharlan v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 678 at paragraphs 22-29. In that case, Justice Fothergill held, even if the IAD’s use of discrete headings in its decision created the appearance of a segmented analysis, it was unrealistic to suggest a more overtly holistic consideration of the evidence would have yielded a different result, as the applicant’s H&C factors were not particularly compelling.

[35]  The case at hand can be characterized similarly. A review of the Decision as a whole does not suggest the IAD misunderstood the Applicant’s arguments. The IAD found most of the factors to be negative, weighing against H&C relief, or entitled to little weight in the Applicant’s favour. There is no basis to conclude that a more overtly cumulative or global analysis employing those factors would have generated a positive result.

C.  Were the IAD’s ﬁndings vis a vis the Ribic test reasonable and made without misconstruing the evidence before it?

[36]  The Applicant raises several areas in which he claims the IAD misconstrued the evidence before it relevant to the H&C analysis.

[37]   First, the Applicant notes the IAD refers to him having a lack of continuing education in Canada, notwithstanding its acknowledgement of his attendance at the Ryerson Bridging Program in 2018. I find nothing unreasonable in this component of the Decision. The IAD clearly understood the Applicant had undertaken the Ryerson Bridging Program. I read the IAD’s reference to a lack of continuing education as a conclusion that the Applicant undertook insufficient continuing education in Canada to assist in supporting a positive finding on establishment, rather than a finding that contradicted its earlier acknowledgement.

[38]  Second, the Applicant refers to the IAD’s finding that the Applicant did not need to remain in Palestine throughout his lawsuit to manage the litigation. The IAD relied on the Applicant’s evidence that he discovered his “presence has no meaning” in December 2017. He submits this finding demonstrates a misunderstanding of his evidence: he originally believed his presence in Palestine was needed for the lawsuit, and he reached the contrary conclusion only when his co-owners appealed the decision.

[39]  I do not find the IAD misunderstood the evidence. Rather, the IAD concluded on a balance of probabilities that the Applicant’s presence in Palestine was not required to manage the lawsuit. It based this conclusion in part on the fact the Applicant had engaged a legal representative, but its conclusion was further supported by the Applicant’s evidence as to his own realization in December 2017.

[40]  Third, the Applicant argues the IAD overlooked his children’s evidence as to the difficulty they would experience visiting him in Palestine. His son testified that, because they were born in Gaza, the family would need documentation from both the Jordanian and Israeli governments in order to travel outside Palestine. His son raised concern that, due to difficulties obtaining such documentation, they may be unable to leave Palestine if they visited the Applicant there. The Applicant also relies on country condition documentation surrounding travel restrictions imposed by the Israeli government.

[41]  The IAD does not expressly refer to the son’s testimony or the country condition documentation upon which the Applicant relies. However, there is a rebuttable presumption that it has considered all the evidence. The IAD concluded there was a lack of evidence that the Applicant’s children would have particular difficulty visiting him in Palestine on Canadian passports, suggesting this analysis turned on the children being Canadian citizens. I do not find the IAD’s conclusion to demonstrate an inconsistency with the evidence that would warrant finding that it overlooked the evidence referenced by the Applicant.

[42]  Finally, the Applicant submits the IAD ignored the country condition documentation surrounding the political circumstances in Palestine, characterized by civil war between factions, periods of open combat, and constant violence and threats of violence. He argues the IAD unreasonably concluded that this hardship was ameliorated by professional and economic success.

[43]  Again, I do not find the IAD’s analysis unreasonable. It recognized the social and political instability in the region, but it noted this has long been the situation there, and the Applicant nevertheless chose to stay in that environment for over eight years after gaining his PR status in Canada. The IAD therefore gave that factor minimal weight in its global assessment. This analysis does not suggest the IAD overlooked or misunderstood the evidence.

[44]  Having considered the Applicant’s arguments, and finding no basis to conclude the Decision is unreasonable, this application for judicial review must be dismissed.

VI.  Proposed Certified Questions

[45]  The Applicant proposes the following questions for certification for appeal:

Should an appellant’s future intent to meet their residency obligations be a factor for the IAD to consider in the context of “rehabilitation”, and does the IAD have the jurisdiction to grant a stay of the removal order in a residency appeal, so as to allow appellants to demonstrate their future commitment to Canada and ability to meet the residency requirement going forward?

Where does a breach of residency obligations fit along the spectrum of breaches of IRPA relative to breaches involving misrepresentation and criminality, and how is the H&C assessment at the IAD affected by this spectrum in light of the H&C discretion inherent in s 28 of IRPA?

[46]  The Respondent opposes certification of both questions, noting that, in order to be certified for appeal under s 74(d) of IRPA, a question must be a serious question of general importance and must be a question that would be dispositive of an appeal (see, e.g., Varela v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2009 FCA 145 at paras 22-29).

[47]  With respect to the first question, as noted in these Reasons, the Applicant did not advance this particular argument, or seek a stay, before the IAD. Moreover, the Applicant has identified no divergence in the Court’s jurisprudence on this issue. This question therefore fails to satisfy both elements of the test for certification.

[48]  With respect to the second question, the legal principles applicable to H&C assessments are well established. Furthermore, given that the outcome of this application for judicial review turns on the reasonableness of the IAD’s consideration of the particular facts of this case, the proposed question would not be determinative of an appeal. Therefore, this question also fails to satisfy the test for certification.

Ottawa, Ontario, December 27, 2017

PRESENT:     The Honourable Mr. Justice Phelan

BETWEEN:




ENCI HUANG




Applicant




and




THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION




Respondent

JUDGMENT AND REASONS

I.                    Introduction

[1]               This is the judicial review of a Refugee Appeal Division [RAD] decision confirming that the Applicant was neither a refugee nor a person in need of protection.

[2]               The Applicant alleged a fear of persecution in China on the basis of his “Shouter” Christian faith.

II.                 Background

[3]               The Applicant, a citizen of China, claimed that he had started attending weekly services of a local Shouter group in August or October 2015 until April 2016 when the Public Security Bureau [PSB] raided the church. He then went into hiding but the PSB continued to pursue him.

[4]               The Applicant then hired a smuggler who arranged his exit using his own passport.

[5]               The Applicant was unsuccessful before the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] and appealed the matter to the RAD. The RAD disagreed with the RPD on several points, but those errors were not sufficient to justify granting the refugee protection order and the RPD decision was upheld.

III.               Analysis

[6]               The overarching standard of review is reasonableness as there are no procedural fairness issues (Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Huruglica, 2016 FCA 93, [2016] 4 FCR 157). This standard of review applies to each of the sub-issues raised.

[7]               The Court was asked to draw a negative inference from the filing of a third party affidavit on the judicial review in lieu of one from the Applicant. Such an inference is entirely reasonable, particularly when the affidavit is based on a “review of the contents of the Applicant’s file”.

Absent a compelling reason, such a failure is “theoretically” fatal, as Justice LeBlanc found in Mabonze v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 309 at para 9, 2017 CarswellNat 1322 (WL Can). It is more than that – such a failure should be practically fatal.

[8]               The assertion that the RAD failed to assess the totality of the evidence in respect of identity documents cannot be made out. Whatever the failings of the RPD, the RAD did specifically examine the documents. The Applicant’s argument is with respect to the weight the RAD gave the documents. There is nothing unreasonable about the RAD’s conclusions.

[9]               The lack of a summons was troubling to the RAD. Contrary to the Applicant’s argument, the RAD did consider country conditions and the likelihood that in those circumstances, at this location, a summons would issue. Its absence reasonably undermined the Applicant’s credibility.

[10]           A fundamental finding against the Applicant was the RAD’s conclusion that his profession of the Shouter faith was not made out. It is an unconventional component of the Christian faith, not easily understood. However, it was fair and reasonable to test the Applicant’s belief (always a delicate matter) to ensure that there is substance behind the profession of faith.

[11]           With respect, and despite the capable arguments of counsel, the explanation that the Applicant is “at the early stages of his journey with Christianity” is insufficient to establish that he is even “on the road.” There must be sufficient substance to the claim of belief to satisfy a decision maker even if an Aquinian grasp of theology is not required.

[12]           In this case the Applicant’s inability to state some of the most fundamental precepts of the Shouters’ beliefs is a reasonable basis to doubt both the claim in respect to China as well as the sur place portion of the overall claim.

[13]           Lastly, in respect to leaving China on his own passport, as noted in this Court’s recent decision in Liang v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 1020 at para 10, 2017 CarswellNat 6160 (WL Can), each of these cases turn on their facts; not being screened may be dispositive in one case, but not in another due to other factors.

[14]           In this instance, the RAD outlined cogent reasons, consistent with other evidence, for not accepting the Applicant’s tale. It is not for this Court to disagree.

IV.              Conclusion

[15]           For these reasons, this judicial review will be dismissed. There is no question for certification.
